{{skill-label | Optional }}
{{requirements}}
* The Trooper enters [[Unconscious State]], and his player declares that he is activating the No Wound Incapacitation Special Skill, whether in the Active or Reactive Turn.
{{effects}}
* The Unconscious State of Troopers using the No Wound Incapacitation Special Skill has the following special rules:
** Instead of placing an Unconscious Token next to the Trooper, place an NWI Token.
** To activate No Wound Incapacitation, the player must announce its use when the Trooper enters Unconscious State.
** Allows the Trooper to ignore the effects and [[Null]] Label of Unconscious State, treating it as [[Normal State]] instead.
** If the Trooper receives another [[Wound]], they enter [[Dead State]] directly and are removed from the game table.
** This Special Skill does not interfere with Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, which will continue to function normally.
* The user of the No Wound Incapacitation Special Skill can be healed (using Special Skills or Equipment such as [[Doctor]], [[MediKit]], [[Regeneration]], [[Protheion]]...), removing one Wound, going back to Normal State, and removing the NWI Token.
* If the Roll to heal the user of the No Wound Incapacitation Special Skill fails, the Trooper automatically enters Dead State and is removed from the game table.
