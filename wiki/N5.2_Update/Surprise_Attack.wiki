* This Attack imposes an additional negative MOD, as shown in round brackets in the [[Unit Profile]] [Surprise Attack (-3), Surprise Attack (-6)...]. This MOD '''only applies to targets of the Attack''' and applies to any {{erratahighlight}}Face to Face{{erratahighlight-end}} Roll that those targets perform in [[ARO]].
* If a specific Attribute is listed between brackets in the Unit Profile, such as Surprise Attack (CC-6), the negative MOD '''only applies to that Attribute''' of the targets of the Attack. This MOD is '''not''' cumulative with other MODs imposed by Surprise Attack, for example if the Trooper has both Surprise Attack (-3) and Surprise Attack (CC-6).
* '''Restriction:''' This Skill cannot be used again until the Trooper returns to Marker form.
