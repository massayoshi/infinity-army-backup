Soldiers with this Special Skill have an uncanny ability to find equipment and gear during their field operations and take some of it as a keepsake. As a consequence, each of them carries a different extra weapon or piece of equipment into battle.

{{effects}}
* Booty allows a roll on the Booty Chart, after placing the Trooper in Model form on the table, in order to determine that Trooper's extra item.
* The item obtained via the Booty Chart is added to the Trooper's gear and does '''not''' replace any of the Trooper's weapons or pieces of Equipment.
