q = Q: During your main part of the Deployment Phase, can you reposition Troopers, Deployables, etc? |
a = A: In their main Deployment Phase step, players can reposition Troopers, Deployables, etc. As soon as a Roll or measurement is made for those game elements, their position is fixed, and they cannot be repositioned during the Deployment Phase.

For example, you can reposition a Trooper as many times as you want, but after you create a Fireteam and adjust the placement of the Fireteam members during the Coherency Check, you can no longer reposition any member of that Fireteam. |
