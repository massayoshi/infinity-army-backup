Some soldiers show such utter disregard for their own lives that even the most crippling injuries will not keep them from reaching their goal.

{{css_skillbox |black| DOGGED | AUTOMATIC SKILL }}
{{skill-label | Optional }}
{{requirements}}
* The Trooper enters [[Unconscious State]], and his player declares that he is activating the Dogged Special Skill, whether in the Active or Reactive Turn.
{{effects}}
* The Unconscious State of Troopers using the Dogged Special Skill has the following special rules:
** Instead of placing an Unconscious Token next to the Trooper, place a Dogged Token.
** To activate Dogged, the player must announce its use when the Trooper enters Unconscious State.
** Allows the Trooper to ignore the effects and [[Null]] Label of Unconscious State, treating it as [[Normal State]] instead, but only for the rest of that Player Turn.
** If a Trooper activates this Special Skill, then in the [[States Phase]] of that Player Turn the Trooper automatically enters [[Dead State]] and is removed from the game table.
** If the Trooper receives another [[Wound]], they enter Dead State directly and are removed from the game table.
* Once activated, Dogged prevents the Trooper from being healed (by Special Skills or Equipment such as [[Doctor]], [[MediKit]], [[Regeneration]]...).
* Troopers with [[Remote Presence]], the [[STR]] Attribute, and Dogged may activate this Special Skill when they enter any level of Unconscious State, but not if they are already in Unconscious State.
* This Special Skill does not interfere with any Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, which will function normally.

{{remember-start}}
[[Shock Ammunition]] cancels the [[Unconscious State]] of Troopers using this Special Skill, and they pass directly to [[Dead State]].
