This section explains how to read the information provided in the Fireteams Chart. To do so, we will use the following Chart as an example, but it is important to remember that the official and current Charts are those shown in the Infinity Army app. 

# Name of the Army or Sectorial.
# The maximum number of each [[Fireteams:_Basic_Rules#Fireteam_Types | Type of Fireteam]] that may be on the game table at the same time. This is checked every time a Fireteam is created. In this case, the Morat Aggression Force may have no more than one Fireteam Core, and no more than two Fireteam Haris, but has no limit on the number of Fireteam Duos.
# When Creating a Rodoks Fireteam, the player may choose to create a Fireteam Duo and/or a Fireteam Haris. Once created, the Fireteams follow the [[Fireteam Integrity]] rules. If the [[Availability]] of the Troopers and the rules for creating Fireteams allow it, the player may have a Fireteam Haris and a Fireteam Duo of Rodoks on the game table at the same time.
# '''When Creating a Fireteam''', you must observe the minimum and maximum number of Troopers that can be part of that Fireteam. In this case, a Hungries Fireteam must include at least one Oznat FTO. '''[[Fireteam Bonuses]]''' apply based on the number of Troopers in the Fireteam who are from the same Unit, or list the name of the Unit or Fireteam in a note or in brackets.
# Different Units that can form the Morat Fireteams. The asterisk (*) in the Min column indicates that, '''when you create''' any Morat Fireteam, you must choose '''at least 1 Trooper''' with an asterisk (*) in the Chart.
#* [5N] Note: The Fireteam Bonus level of a Morat Fireteam depends on how many Troopers in the Fireteam have "(Morat)" or are from the same Unit.
# In some cases, there may be additional conditions for the creation or operation of Fireteams. These notes take priority over the General Rules of Fireteams.
# The 'FTO' term in the chart indicates that, in a Unit, only those options with 'FTO' in their option name can be part of a Fireteam. This includes options such as the FTO Lieutenant, the FTO Hacker, or the FTO-2. However, if a specific FTO is mentioned, for example, the FTO-2, only that option can be part of the Fireteam.
# Wildcards can be part of any Fireteam. The maximum column shows the maximum number of Troopers of that Unit that can be included per Fireteam.
