== Fireteam Creation ==
Each Army has a Fireteams Chart that indicates the quantity and type of Fireteams that the player may create during the game.
* '''During the [[Deployment Phase]]''', place a Fireteam Leader Token (FIRETEAM LEADER), or equivalent, beside one of the Troopers that meet the Requirements of this rule. In that moment, the player must make a [[Coherency]] Check relative to the chosen Fireteam Leader.
* '''During the game''', spend a [[Command Token]] and place a Fireteam Leader Token (FIRETEAM LEADER) beside one of the Troopers that meet the instructions of the [[Fireteams Chart]] of their Army.


{{see-also}}
Creating a Fireteam during the game requires the '''[[Command_Tokens#Command_Tokens:_Operational_Use | Operational Use of a Command Token]]'''.

==General Rules for Fireteams==
* The members of a Fireteam must observe the '''[[Coherency]]''' rule in regard to the '''Fireteam Leader'''.
* A Trooper '''cannot''' simultaneously be part of more than one Fireteam.
* All members of a Fireteam must belong to the same [[Combat Group]].
* When a [[Regular Order]] is spent on a member of a Fireteam, they automatically become the Fireteam Leader. Additionally, they activate the other members of the Fireteam (see [[Fireteam Order]]).
* Fireteams must contain a minimum of two Troopers and a maximum of five Troopers (always observing the Army's [[Fireteams Chart]]).
* Fireteams allow the use of the '''[[Fireteam Bonuses]]''' for two, three, four, or five members, depending on the [[Fireteam_Bonuses#Fireteam_Level_Chart | Fireteam Level]].


== Fireteams and CC Combat ==
* In [[Close Combat]], whether in the Active or Reactive Turn, when several members are engaged in the same CC, '''only''' the Fireteam Leader can be chosen to perform the [[CC Attack | CC Roll]], applying the [[Close Combat with Multiple Troopers]] rule.
* In the Reactive Turn, if the Fireteam Leader is not engaged in that CC, the player must choose one of the Fireteam members who are engaged in that CC to perform the CC Roll, applying the Close Combat with Multiple Troopers rule.
* In [[ARO]], the enemy will be able to target any Fireteam member engaged in the CC, but only one of them.


== Fireteams and Suppressive Fire ==
* A Trooper stops being part of a Fireteam if he declares the [[Suppressive Fire]] Common Skill. In addition, a Trooper’s [[Suppressive Fire State]] is automatically cancelled if they join a Fireteam.


==Fireteams and Comms Attack==
* In the [[Reactive Turn]], if the Fireteam has more than one [[Hacker]] and the player declares a Hacking [[ARO]], every reactive Hacker may use a different [[Hacking Program]].
