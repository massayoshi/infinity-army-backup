== Fireteam Creation ==
Each Army has a Fireteams Chart that indicates the quantity and type of Fireteams that the player may create during the game.
* '''During the [[Deployment Phase]]''', place a Fireteam Leader Token (FIRETEAM LEADER), or equivalent, beside one of the Troopers that meet the Requirements of this rule. In that moment, the player must make a [[Coherency]] Check relative to the chosen Fireteam Leader.
* '''During the game''', spend a [[Command Token]] and place a Fireteam Leader Token (FIRETEAM LEADER) beside one of the Troopers that meet the instructions of the [[Fireteams Chart]] of their Army.


{{see-also}}
Creating a Fireteam during the game requires the '''[[Command_Tokens#Command_Tokens:_Operational_Use | Operational Use of a Command Token]]'''.

When a Fireteam is created, the player must declare which Troopers are part of it, and must follow all the rules and instructions in the [[Fireteams Chart]].

The types of Fireteams that the player may use during a match are:

===Fireteam Duo===

==General Rules for Fireteams==
* The members of a Fireteam must observe the '''[[Coherency]]''' rule in regard to the '''Fireteam Leader'''.
* A Trooper '''cannot''' simultaneously be part of more than one Fireteam.
* All members of a Fireteam must belong to the same [[Combat Group]].
* When a [[Regular Order]] is spent on a member of a Fireteam, they automatically become the Fireteam Leader. Additionally, they activate the other members of the Fireteam (see [[Fireteam Order]]).
* Fireteams must contain a minimum of two Troopers and a maximum of five Troopers (always observing the Army's [[Fireteams Chart]]).
* Fireteams allow the use of the '''[[Fireteam Bonuses]]''' for two, three, four, or five members, depending on the [[Fireteam_Bonuses#Fireteam_Level_Chart | Fireteam Level]].


== Fireteams and CC Combat ==
* In [[Close Combat]], whether in the Active or Reactive Turn, when several members are engaged in the same CC, '''only''' the Fireteam Leader can be chosen to perform the [[CC Attack | CC Roll]], applying the [[Close Combat with Multiple Troopers]] rule.
* In the Reactive Turn, if the Fireteam Leader is not engaged in that CC, the player must choose one of the Fireteam members who are engaged in that CC to perform the CC Roll, applying the Close Combat with Multiple Troopers rule.
* In [[ARO]], the enemy will be able to target any Fireteam member engaged in the CC, but only one of them.


== Fireteams and Suppressive Fire ==
* A Trooper stops being part of a Fireteam if he declares the [[Suppressive Fire]] Common Skill. In addition, a Trooper’s [[Suppressive Fire State]] is automatically cancelled if they join a Fireteam.


==Fireteams and Comms Attack==
* In the [[Reactive Turn]], if the Fireteam has more than one [[Hacker]] and the player declares a Hacking [[ARO]], every reactive Hacker may use a different [[Hacking Program]].

q = Q: During your main part of the Deployment Phase, can you reposition Troopers, Deployables, etc? |
a = A: In their main Deployment Phase step, players can reposition Troopers, Deployables, etc. As soon as a Roll or measurement is made for those game elements, their position is fixed, and they cannot be repositioned during the Deployment Phase.

For example, you can reposition a Trooper as many times as you want, but after you create a Fireteam and adjust the placement of the Fireteam members during the Coherency Check, you can no longer reposition any member of that Fireteam. |
