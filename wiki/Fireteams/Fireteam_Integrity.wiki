In the Active and Reactive Turn, a Fireteam is automatically cancelled in the following cases: 
* The Fireteam Leader enters [[Isolated State]] or any [[Null]] State. 
* The Fireteam Leader declares an ARO different from the [[Fireteam’s ARO]].
* The Fireteam is reduced to one member. 
* If a [[Retreat]]! situation occurs.
* If the player uses a [[Command Token]] to create another Fireteam which does not observe the maximum number of Fireteams of that Type allowed in their Army or Sectorial. In this case, the player must decide which of the Fireteams is cancelled. 
* The Fireteam can be cancelled voluntarily by the player both during the Active and the Reactive Turn, with no additional expenditure of Orders or Command Tokens. To do so, the player must indicate so before the Order is spent by any of the players.

In the Active Turn and Reactive Turn, a Trooper automatically stops being part of a Fireteam in the following cases:
* The Trooper enters or is in [[Isolated State]] or any [[Null]] State.
* The Trooper breaks [[Coherency]] with the Fireteam Leader.
* The Trooper is [[Irregular]] and uses its [[Irregular Order]].
* The Trooper is the [[Lieutenant]] and spends the [[Lieutenant Special Order]].
* The Trooper enters or is in a State that allows it to be substituted by a Marker ([[Camouflaged]], [[Impersonation]], [[Holoecho]]...), unless a Special Skill, piece of Equipment or Scenario Special Rule indicates otherwise.
* The Trooper is moved to another [[Combat Group]]. 
* In the Reactive Turn, if the Trooper declares an ARO that is different from the [[Fireteam’s ARO]]. 

In any of the above cases, the Trooper stops being part of the Fireteam the moment the Order or ARO is declared. '''Consequently''':
* In the '''Active Turn''', that Trooper is not activated by the Fireteam’s Order, so is considered inactive for ARO purposes.
* In the '''Reactive Turn''', that Trooper is not able to benefit from the advantages of being in a Fireteam.
When one or more members leave the Fireteam, the player must recalculate the number of members to check if a '''Fireteam Cancellation''' occurs, or to determine the bonuses available to the members during that Order if there are still enough members for there to be a Fireteam.

{{Greybox-start | Example }}
In a five member Fireteam where only three of them declare an ARO, if two members declare the same Skill in ARO, and the third member declares a different Skill, the Skill declared by the two members has been declared by more than half of the reacting members and is the Fireteam's ARO. The third member will automatically leave the Fireteam.

On the other hand, if two members declare the same Skill in ARO, but two others declare different Skills, then no Skill has been declared by more than half of the reacting members. The player can choose which Skill is the Fireteam's ARO, and the members that declared a different Skill will automatically leave the Fireteam.

==Rejoining the Fireteam in the Active Turn==
Troopers who left a Fireteam can automatically rejoin it if they are in Coherency with the Fireteam Leader during the [[Order Count]] step of their next Tactical Phase.
