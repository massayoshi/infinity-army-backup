{{update | March 2022}}
In Infinity N4, being in a Fireteam grants a set of Bonuses to its members. They are classified into two types:
* Fireteam Size Bonuses. 
* Fireteam Composition Bonuses.

Unlike other multi-Trooper activations, like [[Coordinated Orders]] and their Spearhead, during the Active Turn the Trooper designated as Fireteam Leader will have the full Burst (B) value of their weapon, piece of Equipment, or Skill, plus any applicable Bonus.

{{important-start}}
Unless otherwise specified, Fireteam Bonuses are cumulative with each other, and with other bonuses or Burst MODs provided by other rules, Special Skills, Equipment, or Hacking Programs.
{{important-end}}

Therefore, as a quick reference summary, here is the Fireteam Bonus Chart:

==Fireteam Bonus Chart==

{| class="wikitable-dark"
|-
! Number of Members !! Fireteam Size Bonus !! Fireteam Composition Bonus <br>(same unit)
|-
| 2 Members || Activate the entire FT with 1 Order. || --
|-
| 3 Members || All get +1 [[Burst]] BS Attack. || All get +3 [[Discover]].
|-
| 4 Members || All get [[Sixth Sense]]. || All get +1 BS.
|-
| 5 Members || All get +1 BS. || All get +1 BS.
|}


==Fireteam Size Bonuses==
The number of Fireteam members determines the bonus that the player can apply.


===Two Member Fireteam Bonus===
This Level applies the basic rules of Fireteams, granting no additional bonus.
* During the Active Turn, the Fireteam members activate with a single [[Regular Order]]. 


===Three Member Fireteam Bonus===

{{skillbox |black| BURST SUPPORT BONUS | AUTOMATIC SKILL}}
{{skill-label | Optional.}}
{{Effects}}
* During the Active Turn, the Fireteam Leader can apply a +1 Bonus to the [[Burst]] (B) value of their [[BS Weapon]]s. This Bonus is applied to [[Throwing Weapon]]s but not to [[Technical Weapon]]s. 
* During the Reactive Turn, all the Fireteam members benefit from this bonus. However, all BS Attacks of the Burst must be performed against the same target.
* The +1 B MOD does not apply to [[Entire Order]] Skills ([[Intuitive Attack]], [[Speculative Attack]]...).
* If the Trooper uses this bonus with Disposable Weapons with limited ammunition (for example a Panzerfaust), then benefiting from the +1 B bonus means expending one additional use (see [[Disposable]]). 


{{Greybox-start | Example }}
For example, a Trooper with a Panzerfaust (a weapon with B 1 and two uses) using the +1 Burst bonus would make an Attack with B 2, expending both of the weaponâ€™s uses in a single Order. The Panzerfaust will be unloaded, so the player would place an [[Unloaded State]] Token beside the Trooper.
{{Greybox-end}}


===Four Member Fireteam Bonus===
All Fireteam members gain the [[Sixth Sense]] Special Skill. 


===Five Member Fireteam Bonus===
All the Fireteam members applies a +1 MOD to their [[BS Attack]] Rolls. This Bonus is applied to [[Throwing Weapon]]s but not to [[Technical Weapon]]s. 


==Fireteam Composition Bonuses==
The new specialized and intensive models of tactical instruction allow Troopers from the same Unit to form more integrated Fireteams, thus optimizing their combat performance.

Fireteams that only contain Troopers from the same Unit, and/or those identified as such, have additional Bonuses based on the number of members.

{{skillbox |black| ADDITIONAL BONUSES | }}
{{Requirements}}
The Fireteam must '''only contain Troopers of the same Unit''' and/or those that the Fireteams Chart identifies as such in a note or in brackets.
{{Effects}}
* The additional Bonuses are cumulative with the Fireteam Size Bonuses.
* During both the Active and the Reactive Turn, the additional Bonuses are:
** Three-member Fireteams: All get a +3 MOD to their [[Discover]] Rolls. 
** Four-member Fireteams: All get a +1 MOD to their BS Attack Rolls. This Bonus is applied to Throwing Weapons but not to Technical Weapons.
** Five-member Fireteams: All get a +1 MOD to their BS Attack Rolls. This Bonus is applied to Throwing Weapons but not to Technical Weapons.
* The composition of the Fireteam is checked the moment it is created and also after declaring any Order or ARO with the Fireteam. 


{{remember-start}}
When the number of Fireteam members changes, the player must check both the Size and Composition Bonuses that the members can apply during the Order (see [[Fireteam Integrity]]).
