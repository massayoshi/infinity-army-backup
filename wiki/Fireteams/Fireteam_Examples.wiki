Included below are a set of examples for Fireteam Creation, rejoining Fireteams, and game situations for the different Fireteams. These include Fireteam Charts and options from different Units. Please remember that the official up to date information is found in the [https://infinitytheuniverse.com/army/infinity| Infinity Army] app.

In the Infinity Army app you can check the Unit Profiles and Fireteam Charts for every Army or Sectorial Army, useful tools to help assemble your Army Lists. 


==EXAMPLE 1: Creating a Fireteam==

===Case 1: Trooper Selection and Deployment.===

During the [[Deployment Phase]], a White Banner player wants to build a Zhanshi Fireteam Core. As shown in the [[Fireteams Chart]]s, in order to create a Zhanshi Fireteam Core it is mandatory to include at least 1 Zhanshi. The other members of the Fireteam can be any possible combination of the listed Troopers without exceeding their maximum values. For example, 3 Zhanshi (Paramedic, Missile Launcher, and MULTI Sniper Rifle), 1 Zhanshi Yīshēng and Chief Cheong-Hee Jeong.

{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-ex1plain-2048.jpg | style=fullborder }}
{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-zhanshi-orig.png | style=full }}

After deploying their Troopers, the player selects the Zhanshi (Paramedic) as Fireteam Leader, placing the Fireteam Core Token next to them. At the same time, the player tells their opponent which Troopers are part of the Fireteam and checks that all of them fulfil the [[Coherency]] rule with respect to their Fireteam Leader. Since one of them is outside the [[ZoC]] of the Fireteam Leader, the player places them inside the ZoC, since it is still the first part of the player’s Deployment Phase. 

{{advice-start}}
During the match, the player may create another Fireteam by spending a [[Command Token]]. In this case, they must be sure that all the Troopers that they want to be part of the Fireteam are within the Zone of Control of the Trooper chosen as Fireteam Leader. Troopers that are not in Coherency cannot become part of the Fireteam.
{{advice-end}}


===Case 2: Wildcards and Availability higher than 1.===

Karhu Troopers have Availability 5 in the WinterFor Sectorial Army. As shown in the Fireteams Chart image, as Karhu Troopers are Wildcards they can be part of any WinterFor Fireteam. Also, they are one of the Units that can form a WinterFor Beta Fireteam.

{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-sval-orig.png | style=1024 }}

In the Wildcard Table, the Maximum of 4 indicates that the player may include up to 4 Karhu in the Sectorial's Fireteams. Therefore, a Fusilier Fireteam Core could be made up of 1 Fusilier and 4 Karhu.

In the same way, you can include 2 Karhu in a Fusilier Fireteam Core, 2 Karhu in a Nisses Fireteam Haris, and 1 Karhu in a WinterFor Beta Fireteam. All this is possible because the Sectorial's Availability of 5 for Karhu Troopers is not exceeded and because WinterFor allows 1 Fireteam Core and up to 2 Fireteams Haris.

==EXAMPLE 2: Creating a Fireteam. Bonuses for Size and Composition==

Let us now analyze the Morat Fireteams. The following image shows the Morat Fireteams Charts and the [[Fireteam Bonuses | Fireteam Bonus]] Table. 

{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-morats-orig.png | style=full }}

{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-bonuses-orig.png | style=full }}

In this case, the mandatory minimum to build a Morat Fireteam is that '''at least one''' of the Troopers that has a (*) in the Min column is part of the Fireteam. The rest of the Troopers can be any combination from the Table that does not exceed the allowed maximum. For example:  

===Case 1: Fireteam Core===

* 3x Kurgat (Morat)
* 1x Yaogat (Morat)
* 1x Kaitok (Morat)

Since it is a five-member Fireteam Core, they will all get the [[Fireteam Size Bonuses]] for 2, 3, 4, and 5 members. 
Additionally, since all members have ‘(Morat)’ after their name, they also get the [[Fireteam Composition Bonuses]] for 3, 4, and 5 members.

In summary, all the members of such a Fireteam add the following Bonuses to any MODs shown on their Unit Profile:

* A +1B MOD to their [[BS Attack]]s. 
* The [[Sixth Sense]] Special Skill. 
* A +3 MOD to their [[Discovery]] Rolls.
* A +3 MOD to their [[BS Attack]] Rolls. 

===Case 2: Fireteam Core ===

* 3x Morat Vanguard (Morat)
* 1x Kyosot
* 1x Zabuk

Another example of a five-member Fireteam Core. In this case, all its members will gain the Fireteam Size Bonuses for 2, 3, 4, and 5 members. However, as the Fireteam is not made up entirely by Troopers from the same Unit or with ‘(Morat)’ after their name, they will not get any Fireteam Composition Bonuses.
In summary, all the members of such a Fireteam get the following Bonuses:
* A +1B MOD to their BS Attacks. 
* The Sixth Sense Special Skill. 
* A +1 MOD to their BS Attack Rolls. 

===Case 3: Calculating Fireteam Bonuses ===

The Fireteam Core from the previous case loses the Kyosot and the Zabuk during the match. From that point on, the Fireteam Core, with only 3 Morat Vanguard (Morat) will get both the Fireteam Size and Composition Bonuses (see [[Fireteam Integrity]]).

In summary, all members of this Fireteam get the following Bonuses:
* A +1B MOD to their BS Attacks. 
* A +3 MOD to their Discovery Rolls.

==EXAMPLE 3: Order Expenditure Sequence and AROs (Fireteam in the Active Turn)==

# The Active Player spends a [[Regular Order]] and places the Fireteam Leader Token besides the Trooper that they nominate as Fireteam Leader during that Order. Then they declare the first Short Skill of the Order. Next, they perform a [[Coherency]] Check to find out how many members are in Coherency with the Fireteam Leader, remaining within their Leader's [[ZoC]]. 
# The Reactive Player declares the [[ARO]]s of all their Troopers who can react to any Fireteam member. Each enemy Trooper gets only one ARO against the whole Fireteam. 
# The Active Player declares the second Short Skill of the Order. 
# The Reactive Player declares the AROs of any Troopers who gain an ARO with the second Short Skill of the Order.
# Both players determine what Modifiers (MODs) to apply, and the Active Player applies the corresponding [[Fireteam Bonuses | Fireteam Size and Composition Bonuses]]. Both players make any required Rolls.
# At the end of the Order, during its [[Conclusion]] and after having performed any movement due to [[Guts Rolls]], the Active Player performs a Coherency Check to  see if any member has left the Fireteam, or if the Fireteam has been cancelled.


==EXAMPLE 4: Move and Dodge (Fireteam in the Active Turn)==

In the situation shown in the image, during their Active Turn the Zhanshi Fireteam has declared [[Move]] as the first Short Skill of the [[Fireteam Order]]. The Fireteam grants a single [[ARO]] to each Fusilier, with each one declaring a [[BS Attack]] ARO.

{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-ex4-2048.jpg | style=fullborder }}

In this situation, the Fireteam Leader doesn’t have[[ LoF]] to Fusilier B, so they may only make a BS Attack Face to Face Roll against Fusilier A.

Now the player has to decide if the Fireteam Leader declares BS Attack against Fusilier A, allowing Fusilier B to make a Normal BS Attack Roll against Zhanshi 3. Or, alternatively, to declare [[Dodge]] (a Skill with the Movement Label), so that all the Fireteam members can Dodge. This would result in two Face to Face PH Rolls (one for the Fireteam Leader and another one for Zhanshi 3) against the Fusiliers' BS Attack. The other Zhanshi make Normal PH Rolls. 

{{remember-start}}
During a [[Fireteam Order]], the Skills that are performed by both the Fireteam Leader and the rest of the members are:
* [[Reset]]
* Skills with the Movement Label (except [[Berserk]])
** [[Dodge]]
** [[Move]]
** [[Jump]]
** [[Climb]]
See [[Fireteam Order]]. 
{{remember-end}}


==EXAMPLE 5: Movement Skill (Fireteam in the Active Turn)==

{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-ex5-2048.jpg | style=fullborder }}

During their Active Turn, the Yu Jing player wants two of their five-Zhanshi Fireteam to gain the high ground and declares [[Climb]] as the [[Fireteam Order]]. Both Zhanshi (A and B) climb while the other members of the Fireteam—although also activated by the Movement Skill—do nothing and instead perform an [[Idle]].


==EXAMPLE 6: Changing Leader, and Hacking (Fireteam in the Active Turn)==

During their Active Turn, the player with a Fireteam of four Kamau and one Machinist Varuna Div (Kamau) aims to carry out a Comms Attack against the enemy. To that end, during their new [[Fireteam Order]], they decide that the Kamau [[Hacker]] will be the Fireteam Leader and place the Fireteam Leader Token besides them. 

{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-ex6-2048.jpg | style=fullborder }}
{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-kamau-orig.png | style=full }}

Next, they declare the [[Move]] Skill and the entire Fireteam advances. The Fireteam Leader declares the use of a Hacking Program against the enemy Trooper as the second Short Skill of the Order. In this case, the Fireteam Leader has not declared a [[BS Attack]], so no MOD for Fireteam Bonuses is applied. Additionally, the rest of the Fireteam members perform [[Idle]]s, so the Fireteam Leader is the only one to act. However, even if there is another Hacker in the Fireteam, they would not act and the Fireteam Leader would receive no Bonus whatsoever.

During the following Fireteam Order the first Skill of the Order is declared: Move. After the corresponding [[Coherency]] Check and [[ARO]] declaration, the second Short Skill of the Fireteam is declared: BS Attack.

{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-ex6b-2048.jpg | style=fullborder }}

Both the Fireteam Leader and the other Fireteam members Move, but only the Fireteam Leader performs a BS Attack Roll. Since it is a five-Trooper (Kamau) Fireteam, the Leader applies both the [[Fireteam Bonuses | Fireteam Size and Composition Bonuses]], receiving a +1 B MOD and a +3 BS MOD.

Had [[Discover]] been declared as the second Skill of the Fireteam Order instead of BS Attack, the Fireteam Leader would have been the only one to perform the [[WIP]] Roll, receiving a +3 WIP MOD. In any of the previous cases, the other Fireteam members are vulnerable to enemy Trooper AROs—the opponent would make Normal Rolls, since the other members could not perform any Roll.


==EXAMPLE 7: Changing Leader and Fireteam Suffering a Casualty (Fireteam in the Active Turn)==

Now suppose that the five-Trooper (Kamau) Fireteam has suffered a casualty, who is in the [[Unconscious State]]. With a new Order, the player places the Fireteam Leader Token next to one of the Fireteam members, a Kamau [[Paramedic]]. Next, they declare the first Skill of the [[Fireteam Order]]: [[Move]]. After this they perform a [[Coherency]] Check, verifying that the other members fulfil the Coherency rule and are inside the new Fireteam Leader's [[ZoC]]. All of the Fireteam members are moved and the Fireteam Leader enters Silhouette contact with the Unconscious Kamau. 

During the second Short Skill of the Fireteam Order, the Fireteam Leader uses their [[MediKit]]. Meanwhile, the other Fireteam members are activated by the second Short Skill, but do nothing and perform an [[Idle]] instead.


==EXAMPLE 8: Fireteam ARO (Fireteam in the Reactive Turn)==

{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-ex8-orig.jpg | style=fullborder }}

As seen in the image, a Dāturazi armed with a Chain Rifle spends an Order during their Active Turn and declares a [[BS Attack]] against the five-Zhanshi Fireteam. The Morat player verifies that the Chain Rifle's Large Teardrop Template only affects three of the five Zhanshi (numbered 1, 2, and 3).

If the Yu Jing player declares [[BS Attack]] as the [[Fireteam ARO]], the three Zhanshi will each have to make a Saving Roll, so the player decides not to risk it. Instead, they declare [[Dodge]] as the Fireteam ARO. Zhanshi 4, although unaffected by the Template, will use their Dodge to gain [[Partial Cover]]. Zhanshi 5, already in Partial Cover, declares BS Attack as their ARO. As Zhanshi 5 has declared a different Skill from the Fireteam ARO, they automatically stop being part of the Fireteam, lose all Fireteam Bonuses, and so their ARO only gets [[Burst]] 1 and a +3 Distance MOD. 

Suppose that, in the previous case, Zhanshi 1 to 4 declared BS Attack AROs and Zhanshi 5 a Dodge ARO. Zhanshi 5 automatically stops being part of the Fireteam and the Zhanshi that declare BS Attack only apply the [[Fireteam Bonuses | Fireteam Size and Composition Bonuses]] for two, three, and four members.

{{remember-start}}
If Zhanshi 5 is in Coherency with the Fireteam Leader during the Yu Jing player's next [[Tactical Phase]], the player may apply the rule for rejoining a Fireteam and once again have a five-member Fireteam Core. 

However, if the player is in their Active Turn and they want to have a five-member Fireteam Core without waiting until their next Tactical Phase, they will have to spend a [[Command Token]] and recreate the Fireteam following the Fireteam Creation rules. 
{{remember-end}}


==EXAMPLE 9: Fireteam ARO 2 (Fireteam in the Reactive Turn)==

{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-ex9-orig.jpg | style=fullborder }}
{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-bonuses-orig.png | style=full }}

During their Active Turn, an Arjuna and their Kiranbot declare [[Move]] as the first Short Skill of their Order, in [[LoF]] of the five-Zhanshi Fireteam. All five Zhanshi declare the same [[ARO]], [[BS Attack]], but three of them target the Arjuna while the other two target the Kiranbot.

Thanks to the [[Peripheral (Synchronized)]] Special Skill, the Arjuna and the Kiranbot can choose different targets. The Arjuna declares a BS Attack against Zhanshi 1 as the second Short Skill of the Order and the Kiranbot also declares BS Attack, but aimed at Zhanshi 2. As the Zhanshi make up a five-member Fireteam that belong to the same Unit, all of them can apply the corresponding [[Fireteam Bonuses | Fireteam Size and Composition Bonuses]].

A series of [[Face to Face Roll]]s ensues between the Arjuna, and Zhanshi 1 who has a +3 BS Attack MOD and a +1 [[Burst]] MOD in ARO, so they shoot twice. Since the Kiranbot attacks with a [[Direct Template Weapon]], Zhanshi 2 makes two [[Normal Roll | Normal BS Rolls]] thanks to their weapon’s +1 Burst MOD Bonus in ARO and they also apply the +3 BS MOD. However, they will have to make a [[Saving Roll]] due to the Direct Template Weapon. The other Zhanshi have not been attacked, so they also make Normal Rolls, applying the Burst and BS Bonuses (see image).


==EXAMPLE 10: Fireteam CC Combat vs. L5 Martial Arts (Fireteam in the Active Turn)==

A three-Zhanshi Fireteam Haris in their Active Turn declares a [[Move]] + [[CC Attack]] against Miyamoto Mushashi, who has the [[Martial Arts]] L5 Special Skill. Only the Zhanshi designated as Fireteam Leader can perform the CC Attack, receiving a +1 B Bonus for each allied Trooper engaged in the Close Combat. Miyamoto can apply his Martial Arts Level 5, which grants him B2, and target the Zhanshi Fireteam Leader. A [[Face to Face Roll]] will ensue between the Zhanshi's B3 and Miyamoto Mushashi's B2.

{{remember-start}}
Mushashi can choose any of the three Zhanshi as the target for his B2 CC Attack, but he may only target one of them, since each Reactive Trooper can only target a single Fireteam Trooper (either the Fireteam Leader or any other Fireteam member), although it is not mandatory that all of them choose the same target. 
{{remember-end}}


==EXAMPLE 11: Fireteam Integrity (Fireteam in the Active Turn)==

{{image | name=eng-fireteam_n4-morats-orig.png | style=full }}

We have a four-member Morat Fireteam Core made up of:
* 1x Kurgat (Morat)
* 2x Dartok (Morat)
* 1x Zabuk
While the Zabuk is Fireteam Leader, the Kurgat is killed and they are removed from the game table. Despite the Fireteam having lost a Trooper that was mandatory at the moment of creating the Fireteam, the Fireteam itself is not cancelled as none of the conditions that cause the cancellation of a Fireteam have been met. For the rest of the game, the now three-member Fireteam Core will continue to apply the Fireteam rules as usual.

==EXAMPLE 12: Fireteam Confrontation==

===Case 1: Fireteam Order (Move + BS Attack) against Fireteam ARO (BS Attack).===

With a new Order, the Fireteam Leader of the five-Zhanshi Fireteam declares [[Move]], and the PanOceanian player declares [[ARO]]s during their Reactive Turn since two members of their five-Fusilier Fireteam gain [[LoF]] to the Zhanshi. Both Fusiliers declare a [[BS Attack]] ARO, but each of them can only target one of the Zhanshi that form the Fireteam. Fusilier 1 chooses Zhanshi 1 (Fireteam Leader armed with a Heavy Machine Gun) and Fusilier 2 chooses Zhanshi 2 (Combi Rifle). Both Fusiliers are armed with Combi Rifles and, since they are part of a five-member Fireteam, they have all the [[Fireteam Bonuses | Bonuses]] of a five-member Fireteam in ARO. In this case, both of them can apply the +3 BS MOD and the +1 B MOD.

The Yu Jing player must now decide whether to Attack or [[Dodge]]. Should they declare Dodge and win the [[Face to Face Roll]]s, they could avoid the BS Attacks against both Troopers, but this would not eliminate the threat. If they declare BS Attack, they will apply the Bonuses to the Fireteam Leader, but that would allow Fusilier 2 to make two [[Normal Roll]]s against Zhanshi 2, who would not be able to Dodge or perform a BS Attack, since they would be performing an [[Idle]].

Finally, the player decides to risk it and declares BS Attack, applying the five-member Fireteam Bonuses (+3 BS MOD and +1 B MOD). The player decides to divide their Fireteam Leader's Burst 5 (Heavy Machine Gun B 4 plus the +1 B MOD to BS Attack) between the Fusiliers, with three Face to Face BS Attacks against Fusilier 1 and two Normal BS Attack Rolls against Fusilier 2.

Thanks to the Bonuses provided for being part of a five-member Fireteam, the Fusiliers can shoot in ARO with Burst 2 (Combi Rifle in ARO: B 1 plus +1 B MOD to BS Attack) and with a higher accuracy (+3 MOD to BS).

Both Normal Rolls against Zhanshi 2 are successful and the target, having failed a [[Saving Roll]], enters the [[Unconscious State]].

Meanwhile, Zhanshi 1 wins the Face to Face Roll against Fusilier 1, who also becomes Unconscious after failing their Saving Roll. However, none of Zhanshi 1’s BS Attacks against Fusilier 2 are successful.

===Case 2: Fireteam Order (Move + BS Attack) against Fireteam ARO (Dodge).===

Having lost one of their Zhanshi, the Yu Jing player only has the four-member [[Fireteam Bonuses]] now. Spending a new Order, they place the Fireteam Leader Token next to Zhanshi 3, who is armed with a Combi Rifle and a Grenade Launcher. The player declares [[Move]] as the first Short Skill of the [[Fireteam Order]], but they only move the new Fireteam Leader, who gains [[LoF]] to Fusilier 2. The PanOceanian player, assuming that they are about to be attacked with the Grenade Launcher (which has B 2 thanks to the Fireteam Bonuses), decides to declare [[Dodge]]. The Fusilier Fireteam is now a four-member Fireteam, so they can only apply the corresponding Bonuses. Having declared Dodge, and thanks to their Fireteam Bonuses, the members of the Fireteam have the [[Sixth Sense]] Special Skill. This means that the -3 MOD for Dodging a Template Weapon without LoF to the attacker is not applied. 

Zhanshi 3 declares BS Attack against Fusilier 2. With the Fireteam reduced to four members of the same Unit, their BS MOD is reduced to +1, but they still have the +1 B MOD, so their Grenade Launcher has B 2. The Yu Jing player places the Circular Template on Fusilier 2 and verifies that it also affects Fusiliers 4 and 5. Now the players must carry out the corresponding Rolls to find out how the situation is resolved.


==EXAMPLE 13: Game Situations with Fireteams==

===Case 1: Fireteam Order, Changing Leader, and Movement (Jump).===

During their next Order, the player chooses a new Fireteam Leader, placing the Fireteam Leader Token besides the Zhanshi armed with a Heavy Machine Gun. During this Order, since two of the Zhanshi are on a broken catwalk, the Fireteam Leader declares [[Jump]] as the [[Fireteam Order]]. Next, a [[Coherency]] Check is performed, which confirms that all the Fireteam members are still inside the new Fireteam Leader's [[ZoC]]. Therefore all the Zhanshi can perform the Jump, moving horizontally even though they lack a gap to pass over, and the player indicates where each of them finishes their Jump. At the end of the Order, the player makes yet another Coherency Check.

===Case 2: Fireteam Order, Changing Leader, and carry out mission.===

A Fusilier Fireteam Core is next to a Scenario's Objective Console. The PanOceanian player spends an Order and changes the Fireteam Leader, placing the Fireteam Leader Token next to the Fusilier [[Hacker]]. As the Fireteam are out of range of any enemy Troopers, they declare [[Move]] + Activate Console as the [[Fireteam Order]]. The Fusilier Hacker moves into [[Silhouette contact]] with the Console and makes the required Roll, without adding any Bonuses or MODs for being part of a Fireteam. Meanwhile, the rest of the Fusiliers also move for the first Short Skill of the Order and they perform an [[Idle]] for the second Short Skill.
