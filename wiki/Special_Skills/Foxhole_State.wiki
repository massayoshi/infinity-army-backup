{{skillbox |black| FOXHOLE | }}
{{activation}}
* Automatic during the [[Deployment Phase]].
* During the Active Turn, Troopers may only activate the Foxhole State by consuming 1 [[Entire Order]].
{{effects}}
* The Trooper has a [[Silhouette]] Attribute value of 3 (S3).
* The Trooper has [[Partial Cover]] in a 360&#730; arc, from all directions and angles.
* The Trooper has the [[Mimetism]] (-3) and [[Courage]] Special Skills.
* Foxhole State is a fixed position which doesn't allow its user to perform any type of movement, including movement granted by a successful [[Dodge]] Roll.
{{cancellation}}
* The Trooper enters [[Prone State]].
*  A Trooper in Foxhole State in the Active Turn may automatically cancel this State at the beginning of their movement by declaring a Skill with the [[Movement]] Label. The player must announce he is cancelling Foxhole State when declaring the Skill. By doing so, the State is cancelled at no cost and the Trooper can carry out its Movement using its regular [[MOV]] and [[S]] values. In the same way, in the Active Turn, the Trooper may automatically cancel this State at the beginning of a [[Dodge]] move.
* When cancelling Foxhole State, the Trooper loses all the advantages provided by it, the Token is removed from the game table and the Trooper recovers his MOV and S values.

{{Remember-start}}
