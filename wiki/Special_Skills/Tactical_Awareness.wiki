* This Special Skill grants to its user an extra [[Irregular Order]] in addition to the one provided by their [[Training]] Characteristic (Regular or Irregular).
* During the [[Order Count]] step, if the user is on the game table as a [[Model]] or [[Marker]], the player will place an Irregular Order beside the user.
* This exclusive Irregular Order cannot be transformed into a Regular Order by the use of a [[Command Token]] or other rule or Skill, unless they specifically state otherwise.
* In addition, if the owner of this Special Skill belongs to a [[Fireteam]] and is designated as the Team Leader, this Order can be used to activate the Fireteam.
