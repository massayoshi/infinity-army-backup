{{update | PDF 2.1, July 2023}}
*This Trooper is not required to deploy during the [[Deployment Phase]], remaining off-table until their player decides to deploy them during their [[Active Turn]]. 
* While off-table, the Trooper will not add their Order to the Order Pool during the [[Tactical Phase]]. However, they may enter the table using their own Order to use this Special Skill, when the player chooses.
*By using this Special Skill, the player '''cannot''' place the Trooper in [[Prone]] State, or in [[Silhouette]] contact with enemy and neutral Models, Markers, or Tokens, or in contact with any scenario objective.
*The player may deploy the Trooper on any surface of the game table, as long as the size of the surface is equal to or larger than their base. 
*Deploying inside buildings or enclosed pieces of Scenery is not permitted, even if they have an open roof or open doors or windows as, for example, an Objective Room.
{{c1}}
*After placing the Trooper on their landing spot, the player performs a '''[[PH]] Roll'''. If the Roll is passed, the Trooper lands successfully and remains where the player has placed them. Then, the Reactive Player declares all their AROs. 
*If the [[PH]] Roll fails, the Trooper must be placed within their player's Deployment Zone, always in contact with the edge of the game table. Then, the Reactive Player declares all their AROs. 
{{c1end}}{{n4list}}
* After placing the Trooper on their landing spot, with any Deployable Weapons or Equipment that they can deploy, the player performs a '''[[PH]] Roll'''. If the Roll is passed, the Trooper lands successfully and remains where the player has placed them. Then, the Reactive Player declares all their AROs. 
* '''If the user fails the Roll''', they must be placed within their player's [[Deployment Zone]], always in contact with the edge of the game table. 
* Additionally, after failing the Roll, the user loses the option to deploy in a [[Marker]] State or as a [[Decoy]] and is always deployed as a [[Model]]. Any Deployable Weapons and Equipment deployed alongside him are removed from the game table.
* Then, the Reactive Player declares all their AROs.
* {{erratahighlight}}During the Order this Special Skill is used, the Trooper cannot benefit from Partial Cover.{{erratahighlight-end}}
* When a player moves the Trooper into a different [[Combat Group]], while it is off-table, they must inform their opponent that the Trooper exists. The Trooper's information remains [[Private]], until the Trooper is deployed. 
* {{erratahighlight}}This Special Skill can be used during the Impetuous Phase, which requires removing both the Trooper’s Impetuous Token and their own Order.{{erratahighlight-end}}
* {{erratahighlight}}While off-table, Troopers with this Special Skill can be selected to deploy as part of a Coordinated Order. However, in this situation they will lose their own Order.{{erratahighlight-end}}
* '''Combat Jump (Explosion)''' has the following additional rules:
** After performing the PH Roll and determining the Trooper's final location, the Trooper makes a [[Direct Template]] Attack, placing the center of the Circular Template (Blast Focus) over the center of their base.
** This Attack has Damage 12 with Normal Ammunition, against the ARM Attribute.
** The Trooper is not affected by this Attack.
** This is a single-use Special Skill and its user cannot perform it again.

a = <s>A: A Controlled Jump ARO is considered valid against a Combat Jump Entire Order anywhere on the table, or against any Skill in the Hacker’s Hacking Area.</s><br>
{{erratahighlight}}A: A Controlled Jump ARO can be declared against a Combat Jump Entire Order anywhere on the table, or against any Skill in the Hacker’s Hacking Area.{{erratahighlight-end}}<br>
As an ARO to a Combat Jump Entire Order, Controlled Jump is resolved before the Combat Jump PH Roll is resolved, and will affect that PH Roll. Alternatively, the Hacker can wait until the PH Roll has been resolved, and declare a non-Controlled Jump ARO, if applicable. |
