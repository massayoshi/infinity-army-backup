Troopers with Super-Jump have the ability to perform super-human jumping feats thanks to special gear, augmentations, or evolutionary advantages.

{{skill-label | Movement, Optional }}
{{effects}}
* This Special Skill alters the user's [[Jump]] Skill from an Entire Order Skill to a Short Movement Skill. 
* It also allows Troopers to jump vertically, diagonally or horizontally, up to his first MOV Attribute value in inches if declaring [[Jump]] as a Short Movement Skill, and up to his second MOV Attribute value if declaring a second [[Jump]] as a Short Movement Skill. 
* By transforming [[Jump]] into a Short Movement Skill, the Super-Jump Special Skill allows its user to perform other Short Movement Skills or Short Skills while performing a jump (for example: [[Jump]] + [[BS Attack]]). (See [[Trooper Activation]].)
* The user of this Special Skill may declare [[Jump]] as an Entire Order by adding both values of their MOV Attribute into a single jump. 
* As with the [[Jump]] Skill, by declaring [[Jump]] Troopers with Super-Jump cannot benefit from [[Partial Cover]] MODs during their trajectory of their jump. 
{{n4list}}
* If the Trooper is or becomes [[Impetuous]] (due to having the [[Frenzy]] Characteristic or any other effect), when they activate in the [[Impetuous Phase]] they can use Jump whenever the list of allowed Skills says ‘Move’.

{{remember-start}}
* When declaring the use of Super-Jump, the complete and exact trajectory that Trooper will perform must be specified so the rival player may declare all their AROs. 
* During their entire trajectory, Troopers have a 360˚ [[LoF]].

q = Q: How does Super-Jump work when activating multiple Troopers and not all of them have the Super-Jump Special Skill? |
a = A: If the Troopers declare Jump as a Short Skill, then any of the Troopers that don't have Super-Jump will perform an Idle instead. If the Troopers declare Super-Jump as an Entire Order, they can all Jump but the Troopers with Super-Jump will be able to add both their MOV values together. |
