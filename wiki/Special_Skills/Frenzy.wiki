The Trooper's urge to kill is barely contained. Once he gets a first taste of blood, he will become a whirlwind of death.

{{skillbox |black| FRENZY | AUTOMATIC SKILL }}
{{skill-label | Obligatory, States Phase. }}
{{activation}}
* Automatic in the [[States Phase]] if the user caused an Enemy Trooper to lose at least 1 point of their [[Wounds]] or [[Structure]] Attribute, or to enter [[Dead]] State. 
{{effects}}
* When he deploys, the user does not have the [[Impetuous]] Special Skill. However, if he causes an enemy to lose at least one point from their Wounds or STR Attribute, or to enter Dead State then he will gain the Impetuous Special Skill in the next States Phase, and retain it for the rest of the game.
* When Troopers gain the Impetuous Special Skill, they lose any [[Marker]] State they are in ([[Camouflaged]], [[Impersonation]]...), and any other States that say so. These Troopers cannot re-enter those States.
