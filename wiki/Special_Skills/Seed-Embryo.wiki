{{effects}}
* Troopers with this Special Skill have a dual Unit Profile with two profiles (Seed Form and Developed Form). 
* The user must deploy using the Seed-Embryo profile.
* If the user's Seed-Embryo profile has the [[Camouflage]] Special Skill, the user can deploy in [[Camouflaged State]].
* If the adversary is successful in [[Discover]]ing the camouflaged Seed-Embryo, the Camouflage Marker is replaced by a Seed-Embryo Token (SEED-EMBRYO).
* If the user's Seed-Embryo profile has the [[Combat Jump]] Special Skill, it will be deployed as a Seed-Embryo (SEED-EMBRYO) Token instead of a Model, applying the Combat Jump rule as usual.
* The player will replace the Camouflage Marker or Seed-Embryo Token (SEED-EMBRYO) with the corresponding Model when:
** They perform any Skill with the [[Movement]] Label as the first Short Skill of the Order, or Entire Order. The new Developed Form profile is applied for the entire Order Sequence. 
** They perform a successful [[Dodge]] ARO. The new Developed Form Troop Profile is applied before making any Dodge movement.
