{{greybox-start | Example 1. Martial Arts L3 vs Martial Arts L1}}
{{image | name=eng-ma3-vs-ma1-hsien-cc21-1024.jpg | style=512border }}

During his [[Active Turn]], a Caliban with Martial Arts L3 declares [[CC Attack]] against a Hsien Warrior, a Trooper with Martial Arts L1. Applying the values that correspond to each level, the MODs are calculated:

Active Trooper:

The Caliban must apply the following [[MODs]]:

* +3 for Martial Arts L3.
* +2 to Attack Damage for Martial Arts L3. 
* -3 for the Hsien's Martial Arts L1. 

The Caliban's [[Success Value]] is calculated:

* SV = 23 (23 +3 - 3).
* Attack Damage = 15 (13 + 2).

Reactive Trooper:

The Hsien must apply the following [[MODs]]:

* +1 to Attack Damage for Martial Arts L1.
* -3 for the Caliban's Martial Arts L3. 

The Hsien's [[Success Value]] is calculated:

* SV = 18 (21 - 3).
* Attack Damage = 15 (14 + 1).

{{greybox-start | Example 2. Martial Arts L4 vs Doctor + Peripheral (Servant)}}
{{image | name=eng-ma4-vs-peripheral-1-1024.jpg | style=512border }}

Cuervo Goldstein, with his Martial Arts L4, declares[[ CC Attack]] during his [[Active Turn]], against a Y&#299;sh&#275;ng Doctor and his [[Peripheral]] (Servant). 

The Reactive Player declares [[CC Attack]], choosing the [[Doctor]] to make his CC Attack. The [[Doctor]] will receive +1B in CC since his Peripheral is in the combat. 

Both Players apply their different MODs:

Cuervo Goldstein:
* +3 for Martial Arts L4. 
* +3 to Attack Damage for Martial Arts L4.

Cuervo Goldstein's [[Success Value]] is calculated:
* SV = 26 (23 + 3).
* Attack Damage = 16 (13 + 3).

Y&#299;sh&#275;ng:
* -3 for Cuervo Goldstein's Martial Arts L4. 
* +1B for Combat with Multiple Troopers. 
* The Y&#299;sh&#275;ng's [[Success Value]] is calculated:
* SV = 12 (15 - 3).
* Attack Damage = 10.

{{image | name=eng-ma4-vs-peripheral-2-1024.jpg | style=512border }}

Cuervo Goldstein will perform a CC Face to Face Roll with one die against the Y&#299;sh&#275;ng's two dice in ARO. 

Although it seems like Cuervo Goldstein is at a disadvantage, analyzing the possible outcomes of the Face to Face Roll reveals the following:

Unless the Y&#299;sh&#275;ng obtains a [[Critical]], Cuervo Goldstein will win the Face to Face Roll by obtaining a 6 or higher on his die. Likewise, any result higher than 14 for Cuervo Goldstein will be a [[Critical]]. 

The Y&#299;sh&#275;ng's [[CC]] was reduced from 15 to 12. Although he rolls two dice, his chances of winning the Face to Face Roll are slim.
