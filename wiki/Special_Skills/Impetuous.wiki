{{skill-label | Impetuous Phase, Obligatory. }}
{{effects}}
{{seefaq | Some Effects only apply during the Impetuous activation.}}
* During the Turn's [[Impetuous Phase]], the player '''may''' activate each Impetuous Trooper once, '''without''' spending an Order.
* During the Turn's [[Tactical Phase]], the player will place an Impetuous Token next to every Trooper with this Special Skill. This Token will be removed when the Trooper is activated, or at the end of the Impetuous Phase for any Trooper that has not been activated. 
* Impetuous activations only allow a fixed set of Skill combinations:
** [[Move]] + [[Attack]] (or Attack + Move).
** Move + [[Dodge]] (or Dodge + Move).
** Move + [[Idle]] (or Idle + Move).
** Move + Move.
** [[Jump]].
** [[Climb]].
** [[Airborne Deployment]] Skills. {{seefaq | The Trooper's normal Order will be lost.}}
* When declaring Move, Jump, or Climb, the Trooper '''must''' always move the '''full''' corresponding [[MOV]] value, attempting to perform the first of these options that the Trooper can complete:
:# Enter [[Silhouette contact]] with an Enemy Trooper during this move. 
:# Go towards the Enemy Deployment Zone without doubling back from the movement's starting position. {{seefaq}}
* Troopers may only move a shorter distance if they reach Silhouette contact with an Enemy or a [[Special Terrain]] area hinders their Movement or forces them to declare Jump or Climb.
* An Impetuous Trooper that has not been deployed on the gaming table due to an Airborne Deployment Special Skill may use their Impetuous activation to Deploy during the Impetuous Phase of their player's Turn.
* Impetuous Troopers '''cannot benefit from [[Partial Cover]] MODs'''.
* Players in [[Retreat! situation]] do not carry out the Impetuous Phase during their Turn. 
* Impetuous Troopers cannot enter [[Marker]] States ([[Camouflaged]], [[Impersonation]]...), or any other States that say so.
