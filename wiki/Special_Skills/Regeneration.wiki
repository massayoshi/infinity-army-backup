This Special Skill represents the capacity of certain Troopers to heal from damage they have received, recovering lost points of their [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute.

* Automatic during the [[States Phase]], if the player decides to use this Special Skill. 
{{effects}}
*During the [[States Phase]], the user makes a Normal '''[[PH]]''''' Roll: 
** If the Roll is a success, the Trooper recovers 1 lost [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] point.
** If the Roll is failed, the Trooper loses 1 additional [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] point.
* This Special Skill remains active even when its owner is in a [[Null]] state. 


{{greybox-start}}
If the Trooper loses a point of its [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute, the player should place a Regeneration Token besides the model, as a reminder to perform the check in their next [[States Phase]].
