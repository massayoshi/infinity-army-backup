{{activation}}
*Automatic during the Deployment Phase
*During the Active Turn, Troopers may only return to Camouflaged State by consuming 1 Entire Order, outside the [[LoF]] of enemy [[Markers]] or [[Troopers]]. 
{{Effects}}
*In Camouflaged State, the Player '''does not''' place the Model on the table, but instead places a Camouflaged Marker.
*Camouflaged Markers can possess the [[Mimetism]] Skill, so Camouflaged Markers indicate the MOD level that [[Mimetism]] applies, if they have it.
*You cannot enter [[Silhouette]] contact with an Enemy Camouflaged Marker. 
{{c1}}
*You cannot declare [[Attacks]] against Camouflaged Markers, it is necessary to [[Discover]] that Marker first, unless otherwise specified by a rule or [[Skill]]. 
{{c1end}}{{n4list}}
* You cannot declare [[Attacks]] against Camouflaged Markers, it is necessary to [[Discover]] that Marker first (Discover + Attack maneuver), unless otherwise specified by a rule or Skill. 
{{n4end}}
*To reveal a Camouflaged Marker, a [[Discover]] Roll must be passed, applying [[MODs]] listed for Discover, including the Marker's Mimetism, if they have it. 
*If the [[Discover]] Roll is successful, the Camouflaged Marker is replaced with the corresponding Model, facing in any direction its player chooses. 
*A Trooper that fails a WIP Roll to Discover a [[Marker]] '''cannot attempt to Discover the same Marker until the next Player Turn'''. Note that a Trooper that has been revealed, and re-entered Camouflaged State again, does not count as the same Marker.
*A [[Camouflage]] (CAMO) Marker has a LoF of 360&#730;. 
*A [[Camouflage]] (CAMO) Marker has the same '''[[Silhouette]] (S)''' value as the Trooper it represents. 
: However, '''a Weapon or piece of Equipment '''in Camouflaged State will have a '''[[Silhouette]] (S) '''value of''' 2'''. 
*This State does not interfere with Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, which will remain functioning normally. 
{{c1}}
*The only AROs that can be declared against a Camouflaged Marker are: [[Discover]], [[Dodge]] or [[Reset]]. 
{{c1end}}{{n4list}}
* The only AROs that can be declared against a Camouflaged Marker are: [[Discover]], [[Dodge]], [[Look Out]]! or [[Reset]]. 
{{n4end}}
*When a Trooper in Camouflaged state is activated, each Reactive Trooper can delay the declaration of their ARO until the second half of the Active Trooper's Order has been declared. In this case:
**If the Trooper in Camouflaged state reveals themselves with the second half of their Order (by declaring a BS Attack, moving into [[Silhouette]] contact with an enemy...), the delaying Trooper can declare their ARO.
**If the Trooper in Camouflaged state does not reveal themselves, the delaying Trooper loses their right to declare an ARO. 
{{Cancellation}}
'''The Camouflaged State is cancelled whenever:'''
{{c1}}
*The Camouflaged Marker '''declares''' an Attack or any Skill that requires a Roll. 
*The Camouflaged Marker declares an '''[[Entire Order]]''' of any kind.
{{c1end}}{{n4list}}
* The Camouflaged Marker declares an Attack, [[Look Out]]!, or any Skill that requires a Roll. 
* The Camouflaged Marker declares an '''[[Entire Order]]''' of any kind, other than [[Cautious Movement]].
{{n4end}}
*The Camouflaged Marker enters Silhouette contact with an enemy Model. 
*The Camouflaged Marker is '''Discovered'''.  
{{c1}}
*The Camouflaged Marker receives a successful Attack. 
{{c1end}}{{n4list}}
* The Camouflaged Marker is forced to make a [[Saving Roll]]. 
* The Trooper is or becomes [[Impetuous]] (due to having the [[Frenzy]] Characteristic or any other effect), or enters [[Retreat! State]]. 
{{n4end}}
*When Camouflaged State is cancelled, its player '''must replace the Marker''' with the corresponding Model, facing in any direction the player chooses.
*When replacing the Marker with the Model, the player must provide their adversary with the Trooper's complete [[Public Information]]. 


{{important-start}}
Cancellation of the Camouflaged State is applied to the entirety of the declared Order, even if the Skill revealing the Camouflaged Trooper is performed at the end of the Order.
{{important-end}}


{{remember-start}}
ARO against a Marker:

{{c1}}
*The only AROs that can be performed against a Camouflage (CAMO) Marker are '''[[Discover]], [[Dodge]] or [[Reset]]'''. 
{{c1end}}{{n4list}}
* The only AROs that can be performed against a Camouflage (CAMO) Marker are '''[[Discover]], [[Dodge]], [[Look Out]]! or [[Reset]]'''. 
{{n4end}}
*Against a [[Marker]], the enemy can '''delay''' declaring their ARO until it declares its second Short Skill of the Order. 
*In this case, they may declare an ARO only if the Camouflaged Marker reveals themselves with their second Short Skill of the Order. If the second Short Skill of the Order does not reveal the [[Marker]], the Trooper loses their right to declare an ARO. 
{{remember-end}}


{{n4}}
{{remember-start}}
Camouflaged Markers (CAMO) may be indirectly affected by [[Template Weapon]]s if another non-Camouflaged Enemy Trooper is designated as the Main Target.

==  Examples ==
{{greybox-start | Camouflage and Surprise Attack}}
'''Step 1:'''

A Camouflaged Caliban declares [[Move]] as their first Skill, moving until they reach Cover. 
{{image | name=eng-camouflaged-surprise-attack-1.jpg | style=512border }}


'''Step 2:''' 

The Fusilier decides to delay declaring his ARO against the Marker. 
{{image | name=eng-camouflaged-surprise-attack-2.jpg | style=512border }}


'''Step 3:'''

The Caliban declares [[BS Attack]] as the second Skill of their Order: He indicates that he will use his Boarding Shotgun in Burst Mode to shoot at the Fusilier from Cover, which is the closest point. 
{{image | name=eng-camouflaged-surprise-attack-3.jpg | style=512border }}


'''Step 4:'''

The Fusilier declares [[BS Attack]] with his Combi Rifle, before the Caliban reaches the Cover. 

Remember that the cancellation of the Camouflaged State applies to the entirety of the Order. 

{{image | name=eng-camouflaged-surprise-attack-4.jpg | style=512border }}

'''Resolution:'''

By declaring [[BS Attack]] as the second Skill of their Order, the Caliban has revealed himself for the entire Order, which includes his movement towards the point in Cover. 

The distance between the points where the Skills were declared is measured, and the Face to Face MODs are calculated.
