* The Player may choose to make their [[Saving Rolls]] using either their [[ARM]] or [[BTS]] Attribute, regardless of what is indicated by the Weapon or piece of Equipment used to attack them. {{seefaq | Ammunition and Traits that target one Attribute will not work if the other Attribute is chosen.}}
* This Special Skill does '''not''' apply against [[Comms Attacks]].

{{greybox-start | Example of Bioimmunity }}
A Trooper suffers a [[DA]]+[[Shock]] impact and the [[Saving Roll]] must be made with the [[BTS]] Attribute. Thanks to the Trooper’s Bioimmunity, the Trooper may choose to make both Saving Rolls using their [[ARM]] Attribute, if it was advantageous to them.

q = Q: How does Bioimmunity interact with Ammunition and Traits that reduce the Saving Roll Attribute, for example AP or E/M Ammunition, or ARM=0? |
a = A: AP Ammunition is tied to the Saving Roll Attribute listed in a weapon’s profile. If Bioimmunity is used to make the Saving Roll against a different Attribute, that Attribute will not be halved.
In the same way, if Bioimmunity is used against a hit by E/M Ammunition to make the Saving Rolls against ARM, the ARM value will not be halved.
The ARM=0 Trait only applies if the Saving Roll is made against the ARM Attribute, and vice-versa for the BTS=0 Trait. |
