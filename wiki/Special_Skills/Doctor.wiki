Troopers with this Special Skill have the medical know-how to stabilize their unconscious comrades while in the field, saving their lives and returning them to active duty. 

{{skillbox |green| DOCTOR | SHORT SKILL }}
{{skill-labels | Optional}}
{{requirements}}
* Troopers using this Special Skill must be in [[Silhouette]] contact with their target. 
* The target must have the [[Wounds]] Attribute and be in [[Unconscious]] State.
{{effects}}
* By passing a Normal '''WIP '''Roll, the target's Unconscious State is cancelled, by recovering 1 single point of their [[Wounds]] Attribute, unless a rule or Skill specifies otherwise. If the '''[[WIP]]''' Roll fails, the target automatically enters the [[Dead]] State and is removed from the game table. 
* Troopers may be recovered from the [[Unconscious]] State as many times as necessary, as long as the Doctor passes the '''[[WIP]]''' Roll. 
{{n4list}}
* If the user's Unit Profile lists Doctor (2W), it allows the target to recover up to '''2 points''' of their [[Wounds]] Attribute when cancelling their [[Unconscious]] State. The Trooper cannot surpass their initial Wounds Attribute.
