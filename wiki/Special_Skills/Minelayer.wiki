The user of this Special Skill can secure his point of deployment by placing a Mine, or other Deployable Weapon or piece of Equipment he carries, nearby to prevent enemy Troopers from approaching.

{{skillbox |purple| MINELAYER | DEPLOYMENT SKILL }}
{{skill-label | Optional }}

{{requirements}}
* There can be no enemy [[Camouflaged|Camouflage]] Markers inside the [[Trigger Area]] of the [[Deployable]] Weapon or piece of Equipment when it is deployed, or inside the [[Zone of Control]] for [[Perimeter]] Weapons.
* The deployment of the Deployable Weapon or piece of Equipment must follow the [[Initiative_and_Deployment#Deployment_Rules|Deployment general conditions]] and must always be within the area in which the Minelayer Trooper is allowed to Deploy.
{{effects}}
* In the [[Deployment Phase]], the user may place the Deployable Weapon or piece of Equipment inside his [[Zone of Control]].
* If the Deployable Weapon or piece of Equipment has the [[Disposable]] Trait, then it will be subtracted from the total of available uses.
* If the user deploys using a Special Skill with the [[Superior Deployment]] Label, and fails a Roll to deploy, then in addition to the effects shown in the Special Skill, the Minelayer will lose the Deployable Weapon or piece of Equipment, subtracting it from the total of available uses if it has the Disposable Trait.

{{greybox-start | Example of Minelayer and Infiltration }} 
During the Deployment Phase, a Croc Man Minelayer uses his Special Skills of [[Infiltration]] and [[Hidden Deployment]] to place himself in the enemy half of the table. The player, though not placing a Model or Marker representing the Croc Man on the table, may still lay a [[Mines|Mine]] within the Zone of Control of the Croc Man, but always outside of the enemy Deployment Zone. 

If the [[Infiltration|Infiltration Roll]] is failed, besides losing the ability to deploy in Marker and Hidden Deployment States, the Mine that was laid next to the Trooper will be removed from the gaming table.

q = Q: During your main part of the Deployment Phase, can you reposition Troopers, Deployables, etc? |
a = A: Yes, but as soon as you make a Roll, check Coherency, or ZoC, the positions of those Troopers, Deployables etc. are fixed and they cannot be repositioned.

For example, you can reposition a Trooper as many times as you want, but after you create a Fireteam and adjust the placement of the Fireteam members during the Coherency Check, you can no longer reposition any member of that Fireteam. |

q = Q: In the Deployment Phase do you have to check ZoC when a Trooper uses Minelayer, or Coherency when deploying Decoys or Holoechoes?  |
a = A: Yes, but your opponent must look away so that you can check the ZoC/Coherency without revealing Private Information. |
