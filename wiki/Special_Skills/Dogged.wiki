{{skill-label | Optional }}
{{requirements}}
* The Trooper entered [[Unconscious]] State and his player announced he would activate the Dogged Special Skill, whether in the Active or Reactive Turn.
{{effects}}
{{update | PDF 2.1, July 2023}}
* The Unconscious State of Troopers using the Dogged Special Skill has the following special rules:
** Instead of placing an Unconscious Token next to the Trooper, place a Dogged Token.
** To activate Dogged, the player must announce its use when the Trooper enters Unconscious State.
** Allows the Trooper to ignore the effects and [[Null]] Label of Unconscious State, treating it as [[Normal State]] instead, but only for the rest of that Player Turn.
** At the end of the Turn, the Trooper that activated Dogged automatically enters [[Dead]] State and is removed from play.
** If the Trooper loses one or more further points of his [[Wounds]]{{erratahighlight}}/[[STR]]{{erratahighlight-end}} Attribute, {{erratahighlight}}they enter{{erratahighlight-end}} the Dead State directly and {{erratahighlight}}are{{erratahighlight-end}} removed from play. 
** Once activated, Dogged prevents the Trooper from being healed (by Special Skills or Equipment such as [[Doctor]], [[MediKit]], [[Regeneration]]...).
** This Special Skill does not interfere with Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, which will continue to function normally.

q = Q: How do Dogged and No Wound Incapacitation interact with Coup de Grâce, and with Troopers that have STR instead of Wounds? |
a = A: An Unconscious Trooper that has activated the Dogged or No Wound Incapacitation Special Skills cannot be the target of a Coup de Grâce, the standard CC Attack Rolls must be made.
If the Trooper has STR instead of Wounds, losing a further point of their STR Attribute will have the same effect as losing a further point of their Wounds Attribute - they enter the Dead State. |
