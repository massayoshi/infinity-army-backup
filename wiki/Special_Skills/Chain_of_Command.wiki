{{requirements}}
* The player can only activate this Special Skill when the [[Lieutenant]] enters [[Isolated]] State or any [[Null]] State.
* To be able to activate this Special Skill, the Chain of Command user must be on the game table as a [[Model]] or as a [[Marker]].
{{effects}}
* This Special Skill allows its user to automatically become the new Lieutenant of the [[Army List]], gaining the Lieutenant Special Skill with no extra abilities.
* Even if the previous Lieutenant recovers from the Isolated or Null State, the Chain of Command user will continue to be the Lieutenant.


{{explain-start}}
The [[Lieutenant Special Order]] belongs to the Trooper that generated it during the [[Tactical Phase]]. Therefore, if a Trooper with the Chain of Command Special Skill takes command, they will not be able to use the Lieutenant Special Order if they did not generate it.
