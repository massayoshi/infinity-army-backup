These detection systems can also aid in the precise triangulation of the target, resulting in more effective target acquisition.

{{skillbox |red| TRIANGULATED FIRE | ENTIRE ORDER }}
{{skill-label | BS Attack, Optional. }}
{{requirements}}
* The user must have [[LoF]] to the target.
{{effects}}
* Allows the user to declare a [[BS Attack]] with one of his BS Weapons against a target within LoF by making a BS-3 Roll, ignoring all other MODs ([[Range]], [[Cover]], Special Skills such as [[Mimetism]]...).
* MODs that affect [[Burst]] (B) are applied normally. 


{{Important-start}}
Triangulated Fire does not allow the user to hit a target farther away than the weapon's Maximum Range. For example, a Combi Rifle can never hit a target at a distance of more than 48 inches.
