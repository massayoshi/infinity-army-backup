Troopers with Climbing Plus are particularly gifted in or equipped for climbing and vertical relocation. 

{{skillbox |black| CLIMBING PLUS | AUTOMATIC SKILL }}
{{skill-label|Movement, Optional}}
{{requirements}}
*At the end of the movement, Troopers must be able to place themselves on a surface that is equal or larger than their base. 
{{effects}}
*This Special Skill alters the user's [[Climb]] Skill from an Entire Order Skill to the Short Movement Skill [[Move]]. 
*Climbing Plus allows the user to move along vertical surfaces as if performing a normal Movement on a horizontal surface. 
*By turning [[Climb]] into the Short Movement Skill [[Move]], the Climbing Plus Special Skill allows its user to perform other Short Movement Skills or Short Skills (for example: [[Move]] + [[BS Attack]]) while moving on a vertical surface, or if hanging from a height (See [[Trooper Activation]]).
*As with the [[Climb]] Skill, Troopers using Climbing Plus '''do not''' benefit from [[Partial Cover]] MODs while they are on a vertical surface.
*For visualization purposes, Troopers using this Skill move with at least half of their base's underside in contact with the vertical surface, as indicated in the Requirements of the [[Move]] and [[Climb]] Skills. {{seefaq | You must use the full width if available.}}
*During the [[Reactive Turn]], Climbing Plus allows its owner to react in ARO, if applicable, while being on a vertical surface. 
{{n4list}}
* If the Trooper is or becomes [[Impetuous]] (due to having the [[Frenzy]] Characteristic or any other effect), when they activate in the [[Impetuous Phase]] they can use Climb whenever the list of allowed Skills says 'Move'.

{{Important-start}}
Troopers cannot be deployed on vertical surfaces during the '''[[Deployment Phase]]''' or during the game.
{{important-end}}


{{Remember-start}}
*When declaring the use of Climbing Plus, the complete and exact trajectory that Trooper will perform must be specified so the rival player may declare all their AROs. 
*Troopers have a 360Ëš [[LoF]] during their entire trajectory.

==Examples==
{{greybox-start | Example of Climbing Plus}}
{{image | name=eng-climbing-plus.jpg | style=512border }}

Spending an Order, the Trooper declares [[Move]] as the first Skill of their Order. Thanks to their Climbing Plus Special Skill, as the Trooper moves their first 2 inches and reaches the obstacle, they may continue their movement on the vertical surface, as if it was a horizontal surface. 

Likewise, with the second Skill of their Order, they can choose to keep moving, or can declare any other Short Skill or Short Movement Skill such as [[BS Attack]], [[Discover]], etc.  

Since there are no enemies in sight, the Trooper keeps moving. 

With a second Order, they declare [[Move]] + [[Move]], so they climb down the obstacle and advance until they have used all their movement.

q = Q: While using Move or Climb, can you move 'through' a corner {{erratahighlight}}or overhang the edge of the surface{{erratahighlight-end}}, in the same way that you can move through a space that's half the width of the Trooper's base? |
a = A: No. If the space is wide enough for the Trooper's full base, you must use the full base.

q = Q: How are Jump and Climb movement measured? |
a = A: When measuring Jump or Climb movement, you can measure from any point of the Trooper's Silhouette at the start of the movement, but you must measure to the base's outer edge and underside at the end of the movement. The Trooper can vault over obstacles (parapets etc.) that are equal to or lower than the height of their Silhouette as normal.

{{image | name=faq_jump_climb_measurement_v01.png | style=512border }}

''Development team note: By gaining distance from the Silhouette and allowing the Trooper to ignore parapets (as long as they are equal to or lower than the Silhouette height), movement while Jumping or Climbing is facilitated. This makes these movements easier and gives extra value to Troopers with Super-Jump and Climbing Plus. As we can see in the image, the Jump path is the same even without the parapet.'' |
