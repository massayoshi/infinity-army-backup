{{effects}}
* This Trooper is not required to deploy during the [[Deployment Phase]], remaining off-table until their player decides to deploy them during their [[Active Turn]]. 
*  While off-table, the Trooper will not add their Order to the Order Pool during the [[Tactical Phase]]. However, they may enter the table using their own Order to use this Special Skill, when the player chooses.
* By using this Special Skill, the player '''cannot''' place the Trooper in [[Prone]] State, or in [[Silhouette]] contact with enemy and neutral Models, Markers, or Tokens, or in contact with any scenario objective, or in [[Silhouette]] contact with a scenery element to get Cover.
* The player may deploy the Trooper on any surface of the game table, as long as that surface's size is equal to or larger than their base and is '''in contact with the edge of the table'''. 
* They may not be deployed within the enemy Deployment Zone.
* Once the Trooper is placed on their entry point, the Reactive Player declares all their AROs. 
{{n4list}}
* '''Parachutist (Deployment Zone)''' allows the Trooper to deploy within the enemy [[Deployment Zone]].

q = Q: Are Tactical Awareness Orders generated if a Trooper is off-table during the Order count? For example via Airborne Deployment or Hidden Deployment? |
a = A: No. The second bullet of Tactical Awareness states that the Trooper must be on the game table as a Model or Marker, and Airborne Deployment or Hidden Deployment Troops arenâ€™t. |
