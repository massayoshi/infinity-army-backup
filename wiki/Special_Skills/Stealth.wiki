{{requirements}}
* The user of this Special Skill must be in his Active Turn.
{{effects}}
* The user can declare [[Cautious Movement]] inside the [[Zone of Control]] of enemy [[Model]]s and [[Marker]]s.
* If the user declares a [[Short Movement Skill]] or Cautious Movement within the Zone of Control of one or more enemies and stays outside their [[LoF]], he does '''not''' grant [[ARO]]s to those enemies.
* However, if the second Short Skill of the Order is any non-Movement Skill, then those enemies can react normally in ARO.
* If the Movement of the Trooper with Stealth ends in [[Silhouette contact]] with an enemy who had no LoF against them and declares any non-Movement Short Skill, then the enemy can only declare [[CC Attack]], [[Dodge]], [[Reset]], or those Skills that can be used in [[Engaged State]].
* This CC Special Skill can be declared without being in Silhouette contact with an enemy.


{{Important-start}}
Stealth is not effective against [[Deployable Weapon]]s, or against Troopers with the [[Sixth Sense]] Special Skill.
