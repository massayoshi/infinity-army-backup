Hyper-developed senses and sophisticated tracking technology are the two sides of the Sensor coin. Either way, the bottom line is the same: the ability to uncover hidden threats in one's immediate surroundings.

* By declaring Sensor, the user may make a Normal [[WIP]]+6 Roll (without applying [[Range]] or [[Mimetism]] MODs) '''to simultaneously Discover all enemy''' Troopers, Weapons or pieces of Equipment in the [[Hidden Deployment]] or [[Camouflaged State]]s, who are inside the user's [[Zone of Control]].
* The user does not need [[LoF]] to a target, or to designate a target at all.
* Enemies with the [[Camouflage]] Special Skill cannot regain Camouflaged State inside the Zone of Control of the user.
* Sensor also grants its user, automatically and without making Rolls or spending Orders, a +6 MOD to [[WIP]] when declaring [[Discover]] against Camouflage Markers.
