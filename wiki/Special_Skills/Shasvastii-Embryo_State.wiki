* The Trooper with the [[Shasvastii]] Special Skill enters [[Unconscious]] State. 
{{effects}}
In game terms, this State works like [[Unconscious]] State with the following features:
* Rather than placing an Unconscious State Token besides the Trooper, a Shasvastii Embryo State Token is placed instead.
{{c1}}
* The Trooper counts as being in a non-[[Null]] state when computing [[Victory Points]], and they do not count as Troopers eliminated by the enemy. 
{{c1end}}{{n4list}}
* '''During the game''', Troopers in this State are counted when calculating [[Victory Points]] for the [[Retreat! situation]], and for any other rules or conditions required by the scenario. 
* '''At the end of the game''', Troopers in this State are treated like Unconscious Troopers, so they are '''not''' counted when calculating Victory Points.
