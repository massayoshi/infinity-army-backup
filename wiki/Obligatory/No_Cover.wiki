For a variety of reasons (agility, size, training...), the Trooper cannot benefit from any of the MODs granted by Partial Cover. 

{{css_skillbox |black| NO COVER | AUTOMATIC SKILL }}
{{skill-label | Obligatory. }}
{{effects}}
* Troopers with this Special Skill do '''not''' benefit from '''[[Partial Cover]]''' MODs.

{{advice-start}}
Keep in mind that the most severe restriction always applies. If a '''[[No Cover]]''' Trooper also has '''[[Limited Cover]]''' due to another rule or Skill, the No Cover Skill will still apply.
