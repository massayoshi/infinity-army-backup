{{effects}}
* If a Trooper with this Special Skill enters [[Unconscious State]], they automatically pass directly to [[Dead State]], without receiving an extra [[Wound]], and must be removed from the game table.
* Therefore the Trooper '''cannot''' be healed in any way (through the use of Special Skills or Equipment such as [[Doctor]], [[MediKit]], [[Regeneration]]...).
* This Special Skill remains active even when its owner is in a [[Null]] State.
