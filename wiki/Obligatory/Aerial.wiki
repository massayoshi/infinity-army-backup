{{advice-start}}
The aerial movement of Troopers with this Skill is represented using the [[Super-Jump]] and [[Terrain]] (Total) Special Skills, which are listed in their [[Unit Profile]]s. Similarly, the fact that these Troopers are harder to hit due to their higher speed and the height they can fly at is represented by the [[Mimetism]] or [[Albedo]] Special Skills.

In addition, it is impossible to enter [[Silhouette contact]] with these Troopers unless they are in [[Unconscious State]], so if they are not Unconscious any [[Wounds]] they have received can only be removed by using a [[GizmoKit]].
