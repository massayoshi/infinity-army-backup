{{requirements}}
* The Trooper with this Special Skill must be part of a [[Fireteam]]. 
{{effects}}
* In the [[Order Count]] step of the Tactical Phase, if this Trooper is part of a Fireteam, all the members of that Fireteam are [[Regular]]. 
* If all members of the Fireteam already have the Regular Characteristic on their [[Unit Profile]], apply a +2 inch bonus to the Team Leader's [[Zone of Control]] when making [[Coherency]] Checks for the Fireteam.
* If a Unit name is listed in brackets after this Special Skill in the Trooper's Unit Profile, and the Trooper's Fireteam contains any members belonging to that Unit, the Fireteam is automatically canceled if the FT Master Trooper is no longer in the Fireteam.
