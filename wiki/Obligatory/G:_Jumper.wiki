Troopers with this Special Skill have several bodies available on the game table they can activate, jumping from one to another to always be in the thick of the action.

{{skill-label | Obligatory }}

{{requirements}}
* The player must enlist either two or three Proxies available to a Trooper with this Special Skill.
* All the Proxies of a G: Jumper Trooper must be in the same [[Combat Group]], where they are counted as only one Trooper.
{{effects}}
* This Special Skill allows its user to have several Models called Proxies.
* A G: Jumper Trooper provides a single [[Order]] no matter how many Proxy Models he has.
* This Special Skill allows G: Jumper Troopers to deploy two or three Proxies, applying any Deployment Special Skills they might have ([[Airborne Deployment]], [[Infiltration]]...).
* Players do not need to place the Active Proxy Token in the [[Deployment Phase]].
* During the Active Turn, the G: Jumper Trooper can activate any of his Proxies by placing the Active Proxy Token beside the Proxy he wants to activate when declaring the Order.
* The only Proxy that can declare Orders is the one with the Active Proxy Token.
* During the Reactive Turn, if an Order allows several Proxies that belong to the same G: Jumper Trooper to react in [[ARO]], then the player must choose only one of them to be the Active Proxy by placing the Active Proxy Token beside it.
* Active Proxies can react in ARO normally.
* Any Inactive Proxies that react in ARO can only declare [[Dodge]] or [[Reset]].
* At the end of the Order in which a Proxy entered [[Isolated State]], or any [[Null]] State, the player can place the Active Proxy Token beside any of the G: Jumper Trooper's other Proxies which is not in Isolated State, or any Null State.
* A G: Jumper Trooper cannot activate a Proxy in Isolated State, or any Null State, until the State is cancelled.
* If all the Proxies of a G: Jumper Trooper are in Isolated State, or any Null State, then the G: Jumper Trooper will be considered a casualty until at least one of his Proxies recovers from the State.

=== G: Jumper and [[Victory Points]] ===
The player must count separately each Proxy’s Cost Attribute value of its [[Unit Profile]].

=== G: Jumper and Lieutenant ===
If the G: Jumper Trooper is the [[Lieutenant]] and all his Proxies are in [[Isolated State]] or any [[Null]] State, that will result in a [[Loss of Lieutenant]] situation. This situation can be cancelled normally.

=== G: Jumper, Hidden Deployment and Marker States ===
Placing an Active Proxy Token beside a Proxy that is in a Marker State ([[Camouflaged]], [[Impersonation State | Impersonation]], [[Holoecho]]...) doesn’t reveal the Proxy, because the Proxy hasn’t declared any Skills yet.

The same applies to [[Hidden Deployment State]], activating the Proxy doesn’t reveal the Trooper. So, it is not required that the player place the Active Proxy Token on the game table until the moment he declares an Order or ARO with the hidden Trooper.

=== G: Jumper and Combat Groups ===
When a player moves a G: Jumper Trooper into a different [[Combat Group]], he will move all the Proxies, as they are considered to be a single Trooper in each Combat Group.

=== G: Jumper and Suppressive Fire === 
If a Trooper with G: Jumper has a Proxy in [[Suppressive Fire State]], that Proxy stays in Suppressive Fire State even if another Proxy is activated.


== Examples ==

{{greybox-start | Active Turn Game Example }}
A Posthuman Trooper has 3 Proxies on the battlefield. A Proxy Mk.2 ([[Infiltration | infiltrated]] and [[Camouflaged]]) armed with a MULTI Sniper Rifle, a Proxy Mk.1 ([[Engineer]]) with a Combi Rifle and a Proxy Mk.5 [[Forward Observer]], placed in the [[Deployment Zone]]. The Posthuman Trooper decides to activate her infiltrated Proxy Mk.2, placing the Active Proxy Token beside it and declaring her Order: [[Move]] + [[BS Attack]]. The successful shots of her Sniper Proxy clear the path for her Proxy Mk.5 Forward Observer.

So, she places the Active Proxy Token beside the Mk.5 and declares her next Order: Move + Move. That is the end of the ALEPH player’s Active Turn, with the Active Proxy Token beside the Proxy Mk.5 Forward Observer.

{{greybox-start | Reactive Turn Game Example }}

Then, the Active Turn of her opponent begins. A Trooper with the [[Combat Jump]] Special Skill lands in the rearguard of the ALEPH player, in [[LoF]] of the Inactive Proxy Mk.2, and in the [[ZoC]] of the Proxy Mk.5, the Active Proxy. The ALEPH player reacts with both Proxies, and decides to jump into the Proxy Mk.2, which becomes the Active Proxy and declares its [[ARO]]: [[BS Attack]]. In addition, the Inactive Proxy Mk.5 declares a [[Dodge]] ARO, to face the threat of the enemy.

{{image | name=n5/eng-jumper-example-2v2.jpg | style=fullborder }}

Since the enemy’s Combat Jump is a Long Skill, no [[Face to Face Rolls]] are made with the Proxies. Both Proxies pass their Rolls, so the enemy must make a [[Saving Roll]] and the Proxy Mk.5 can use Dodge movement and face in the direction its player wishes.
