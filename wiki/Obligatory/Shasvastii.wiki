{{requirements}}
* The Trooper enters [[Unconscious State]], and his player declares that he is activating the Shasvastii Special Skill, whether in the Active or Reactive Turn.
{{effects}}
* The Unconscious State of Troopers using the Shasvastii Special Skill (usually referred to as 'Shasvastii-Embryo') has the following special rules:
** Instead of placing an Unconscious Token next to the Trooper, place a Shasvstii-Embryo Token.
** To activate Shasvastii, the player must announce its use when the Trooper enters Unconscious State.
** '''During the game''', the Trooper is counted when calculating [[Victory Points]] for the [[Retreat Situation | Retreat! situation]], and for any other rules or conditions required by the scenario.
** '''At the end of the game''', the Trooper's Unconscious State loses these special rules, so they are not counted when calculating Victory Points.
