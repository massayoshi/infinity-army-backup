q = Q: Area of Interest - How do AROs interact with Activate Communication Antenna?  |
a = A: After the Specialist Troop's first Basic Short Skill of the Order, '''one''' enemy Hacker who is in an Area of Interest and has been granted an ARO (for example via LoF or Hacking Area) can declare an 'Oppose Activation' ARO. 

If 'Oppose Activation' '''isn't''' declared, after the Specialist Troop declares Activate Communication Antenna as their second Short Skill, '''one''' enemy Hacker in an Area of Interest is granted an ARO, which can '''only''' be used to declare 'Oppose Activation'. 

'Oppose Activation' is the only ARO that results in a FtF WIP Roll against Activate Communication Antenna. Any other ARO will be a Normal Roll. |
