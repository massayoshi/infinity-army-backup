Impetuous Troopers are always eager to engage in combat: the closer and the nastier, the better.

{{effects}}
* During the Turn's [[Tactical Phase]], the player will place an Impetuous Token next to every Trooper with this Special Skill. This Token will be removed when the Trooper is activated, or at the end of the [[Impetuous Phase]] for any Trooper that has not been activated.
* During the Turn's Impetuous Phase, the player '''may activate''' each Impetuous Trooper once, '''without spending an [[Order]]'''. However, removing the Impetuous Token to activate the Trooper counts as spending an Order on them, applying the [[Order Expenditure Sequence]] normally.
* '''Restriction''': Impetuous activations only allow a fixed set of Skill combinations:
** [[Move]] + [[CC Attack]].
** Move + [[BS Attack]].
** Move + [[Dodge]].
** Move + [[Idle]].
** Move + Move.
** [[Jump]].
** [[Climb]].
** [[Berserk]].
** Skills with the [[Airborne Deployment]] Label.
** Those Skills that specify they can be used during the Impetuous Phase.
* '''Restriction''': In the Impetuous Phase, when declaring a Skill with the [[Movement Label]], the Trooper must always move '''the full corresponding [[MOV]] value''', attempting to perform the first of these options that the Trooper can complete:
** Enter [[Silhouette contact]] with an [[Enemy]] Trooper during this move.
** Go towards the Enemy [[Deployment Zone]] '''without doubling back''' from the movement's starting position, applying the following priorities:
*** 1. Use their complete MOV value.
*** 2. End their movement as close to the Enemy Deployment Zone as possible.
*** 3. If they cannot end their movement closer to the enemy Deployment Zone, the Trooper performs an [[Idle]].
** Once inside the enemy Deployment Zone, the Trooper can move normally as long as they stay inside it.
* Troopers may only move a shorter distance if they reach Silhouette contact with an Enemy or a [[Special Terrain]] area hinders their Movement or forces them to declare Jump or Climb.
* In the Impetuous Phase, when declaring Move, Jump, or Climb, the Trooper must cancel [[Prone State]], move the full corresponding MOV value, and cannot enter Prone State at the end of the movement.
* '''Restriction''': Impetuous Troopers cannot enter Marker States ([[Camouflaged]], [[Impersonation State | Impersonation]]...), or any other States that say so.
* Players in [[Retreat Situation | Retreat! situation]] do not carry out the Impetuous Phase during their Turn.
