Hacking Devices are the tools used during cybercombat. Multipurpose and versatile, these devices can be useful as support elements or to perform powerful cyberattacks, depending on the Device.


{{see-also-start}}
From [[Quantronic_Combat_(Hacking)#Hacking_Devices_and_Hacking_Programs:_Characteristics | Quantronic Combat (Hacking)]].

[[Hacking Device]]s and Hacking Programs have the following characteristics:
*They act in the user's [[Hacking Area]].
*They do not require [[LoF]] to act, unless the Hacking Program's own description states otherwise. 
* Only Troopers in Model form may be targeted by [[Hacking Program]]s.
* They benefit, if applicable, from the target's [[Targeted]] State.
