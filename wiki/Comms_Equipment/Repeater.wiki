* Hackers within the [[Zone of Control]] of an enemy Repeater may use it to apply Hacking Programs against any enemy Hacker, but applying [[Firewall]] MODs (-3).

{{remember-start}}
[[Firewall]] imposes an additional MOD (-3, -6...) to the [[WIP]] Roll of the Trooper declaring a [[Comms Attack]] against a Trooper benefitting from a Firewall, for example if attacking through an enemy [[Repeater]].

The Trooper benefiting from the Firewall also applies a MOD of +3 to their [[Saving Roll]]s (SR) against the Comms Attack.

Only the MODs of a single Firewall can be applied, even if the Trooper benefits from more than one. In the case of the Trooper benefitting from more than one Firewall, their player will decide which one to apply.
