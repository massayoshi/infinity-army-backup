{{css_skillbox |black| SATURATION | }}
This characteristic describes the existence of solid obstacles that can limit the effectiveness of projectiles that traverse the area.

{{Effects}}
* Any [[BS Attack]] from, into, or through a Saturation Zone suffers a -1 [[Burst]] MOD.
** This MOD is applied after dividing the Burst between one or more targets, and is applied to the Burst value assigned to each target.
** The Burst value assigned to a target cannot be reduced below 1.
* The Burst MODs for Saturation Zones never stack with MODs for other Saturation Zones. For example, if the [[LoF]] of a BS Attack is draw through several Saturation Zones, the player will apply only a -1 Burst MOD.
