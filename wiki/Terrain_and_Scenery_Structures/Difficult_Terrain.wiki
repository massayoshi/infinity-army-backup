{{css_skillbox |black| DIFFICULT TERRAIN | }}
Some of the battlefieldâ€™s zones may feature certain advantages or impairments to the Movement of Troopers attempting to cross them.

{{requirements}}
* Troopers must apply the Difficult Terrain rules when their [[Silhouette]] is inside or in contact with a Difficult Terrain area and they declare a Skill with the [[Movement Label]] such as [[Move]], [[Cautious Movement]], [[Climb]], [[Jump]], or the [[Berserk]] Special Skill.
* Difficult Terrain also affects Troopers who make [[Silhouette contact]] with it during an Order.

{{effects}}
* Entering Silhouette contact with a Difficult Terrain area immediately and automatically ends the Trooper's Movement, regardless of its type, for the rest of the [[Trooper Activation | Order]].
* If the Trooper chooses to continue to move through the Difficult Terrain area, they must declare a new Order and apply a MOD of -1 inch to both values of their [[MOV]], or to the value specified by any Skill involved, such as Jump.
