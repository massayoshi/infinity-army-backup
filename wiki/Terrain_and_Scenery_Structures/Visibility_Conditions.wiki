{{css_skillbox |black| VISIBILITY CONDITIONS | }}
Due to thick vegetation, jagged rocks, snow, sandstorms and any number of other reasons, some areas obscure a soldier’s vision and his ability to aim accurately. This is represented by the following game rules. Vision-obscuring areas are divided into four categories:
* Low Visibility Zone
* Poor Visibility Zone
* Zero Visibility Zone
* White Noise Zone

{{effects}}
* Any Skill, Special Skill or piece of Equipment that requires [[LoF]], except [[Dodge]], and is performed from, into, or through a Visibility Zone suffers a MOD to the relevant Attribute in the required Roll.
* This MOD for Visibility stacks with other MODs for Special Skills, Equipment, [[Partial Cover]], [[Range]]... but never with other Zone of Visibility MODs.

=== Low Visibility Zone ===
* Low Visibility Zones apply a MOD of -3.

=== Poor Visibility Zone ===
* Poor Visibility Zones apply a MOD of -6.

=== Zero Visibility Zone ===
* [[LoF]] cannot be drawn into, through, or out of a Zero Visibility Zone.
* Any Trooper who is the target of a [[BS Attack]] into, through, or out of a Zero Visibility Zone treats the Zero Visibility Zone as a Poor Visibility Zone when drawing LoF to the attacker.

=== White Noise Zone ===
* A White Noise Zone acts as a Zero Visibility Zone, but only for Troopers with the [[Marksmanship]] Special Skill or equipped with a [[Multispectral Visor]] of any Level, or any other piece of Equipment that specifies the same.
* If a Trooper with a Multispectral Visor is the target of a [[BS Attack]] into, through, or out of a White Noise Zone, their Multispectral Visor cannot reduce the MODs of the resulting Poor Visibility Zone.

{{important}}
Visibility Zone MODs never stack with other Visibility Zone MODs. If any Roll would be affected by two or more Visibility Zones of whatever type, players will apply only one MOD, that must be always the most restrictive one.

For example, if a [[BS Attack]]’s [[LoF]] passes through a Low Visibility Zone (-3 MOD) and a Poor Visibility Zone (-6 MOD), apply only one single -6 MOD.

== Visibility Zones and Speculative Attack ==
[[Speculative Attack]]s do not require [[LoF]], so do not apply any negative MODs for Visibility Zones, only the -6 MOD for Speculative Attack.

== Visibility Conditions and Combat Jump ==
You cannot use [[Combat Jump]] inside of, or in contact with, an area with Low, Poor, or Zero Visibility Conditions.
