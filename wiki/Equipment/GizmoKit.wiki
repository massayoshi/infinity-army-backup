Special piece of Equipment that allows other Models with the Structure Attribute to remove Wounds.

{{css_skillbox |green| GIZMOKIT | SHORT SKILL }}
{{weapon-label | Non-Lethal }}
{{requirements}}
* The target of a GizmoKit must be an [[Allied]] Model with the [[STR]] Attribute. 
* A GizmoKit can be used in one of two ways, each one with their own Requirements:
** To use it remotely, the user must have LoF to the target.
** To use it as a piece of contact equipment, the user must be in Silhouette contact with the target.
{{effects}}
* Used remotely, a GizmoKit is a Non-Lethal BS Weapon. If the user passes a [[BS Attack]] Roll, applying the corresponding MODs (for [[Range]], [[Cover]], etc.), the target performs a single [[PH]] Roll.
* A GizmoKit can also be used in [[Silhouette contact]]. To do so, the user must spend one Short Skill, without the need for a Roll, and their target performs a PH Roll.
* In both cases, by passing the PH Roll, the target removes a [[Wound]]. This cancels [[Unconscious State]] if applicable. If the PH Roll is failed, the target receives a Wound instead of removing it, entering Unconscious or [[Dead State]] if applicable.
* The target of a GizmoKit does not perform a [[Saving Roll]].
* A GizmoKit can be used as many times as necessary to remove all the Wounds that the target has.
* If, due to a Special Skill or rule, a Trooper receives more than one successful hit or use of GizmoKit during the same Order, if any of the corresponding PH Rolls is successful, the Trooper removes a Wound. Even if the Trooper passes every PH Roll, they only remove one single Wound.

* {{erratahighlight}}The user can apply this piece of Equipment on themselves, to remove any Wounds they have received, or cancel any states that can be canceled by a GizmoKit. However, this '''cannot''' be done if the user is in a '''Null''' State.{{erratahighlight-end}}
{{update-end}}
* If a Trooper lists GizmoKit in their [[Unit Profile]] with a PH value between brackets, the Trooper will use this PH value when a GizmoKit is used on them.

=== GizmoKit and Remote Presence ===
* '''GizmoKit and Remote Presence:'''
** Regardless of which level of Unconscious State the target is in, with a single successful PH Roll, they remove all the Wounds necessary to cancel their Unconscious State.
