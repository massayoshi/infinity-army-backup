* An [[Allied]] Trooper in a Non-[[Null]] state and inside the [[Zone of Control]] of this Trooper may perform the [[Reload]] Common Skill to either cancel their [[Unloaded State]], or to regain all expended uses of their [[Disposable]] weapons or pieces of Equipment. This effect may only be applied to a single Allied Trooper per Order.
* In the [[States Phase]], each Allied Trooper inside the Zone of Control of this Trooper may automatically cancel their Unloaded State, or regain all expended uses of their Disposable weapons or pieces of Equipment.
* Recovering the use of Disposable weapons and pieces of Equipment does not affect any weapons and pieces of Equipment that were already deployed on the gaming table.
