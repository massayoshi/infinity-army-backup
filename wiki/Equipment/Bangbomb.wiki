Users of Bangbombs often throw them at their own feet while dodging enemy fire, because, when the Bangbombs hit the ground and detonate, they create a curtain of reflective particles that enhance the flash of the blast, making it easier for the user to dodge and evade enemy attacks.

During their Active Turn, the player activates a Trooper with BangBomb (+4), declaring [[Move]] as the first Skill of the Order. Two enemy Troopers in [[LoF]] declare their [[ARO]]s, both [[BS Attack]], one with a Combi Rifle and the other with an E/Marat, a [[Template Weapon]]. 

The Active Trooper then declares [[Dodge]] as the second Skill of the Order. Thanks to BangBomb (+4), they have a MOD of +4 to their Dodge Roll against the enemy with the Combi Rifle. Since the Active Trooper has PH 13, their [[Success Value]] is 17 (13+4). As the BangBomb MOD does not apply against Attacks with Template Weapons, their Success Value to Dodge the Template is 13. 

Dice are rolled, and the Active Trooper gets a 14. This is enough to win the [[Face to Face]] Roll against the enemy with a Combi Rifle, who rolls a 9. 

However, the E/Marat Template hits the Active Trooper. As the Bangbomb MOD does not apply against Template Weapons, the Trooper would have needed to roll a 13 or less. 

By failing to Dodge the Template, the Trooper is unable to move up to 2 inches, even though he succeeded against the Combi Rifle Attack.
