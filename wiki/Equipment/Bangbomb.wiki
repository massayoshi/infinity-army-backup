{{n5-section-equipment}}


Users of Bangbombs often throw them at their own feet while dodging enemy fire, because, when the Bangbombs hit the ground and detonate, they create a curtain of reflective particles that enhance the flash of the blast, making it easier for the user to dodge and evade enemy attacks.
