{{requirements}}
* A MediKit's target must be an [[Allied]] Model with the [[VITA]] Attribute and in [[Unconscious State]], unless certain scenario rules say otherwise.
* A MediKit can be used in one of two ways, each one with their own Requirements:
** To use it remotely, the user must have [[LoF]] to the target.
** To use it as a piece of contact equipment, the user must be in [[Silhouette contact]] with the target.

{{effects}}
* Used remotely, a MediKit is a Non-Lethal BS Weapon. If the user passes a [[BS Attack]] Roll, applying the corresponding MODs (for [[Range]], [[Cover]], etc.), the target performs a single [[PH]] Roll.
* A MediKit can also be used in [[Silhouette contact]]. To do so, the user must spend one Short Skill without needing a Roll, and their target performs a PH Roll.
* In both cases, by passing the PH Roll, the target may remove one [[Wound]] and cancel their [[Unconscious State]]. If the PH Roll is failed, the target automatically enters [[Dead State]] and is removed from the game table.
* The target of a MediKit does not perform a [[Saving Roll]].
* A MediKit can be used as many times as necessary to cancel a Trooper's Unconscious State, as long as they pass the corresponding PH Roll.
* If, due to a Special Skill or rule, a Trooper receives more than one successful hit or use of MediKit during the same Order, if any of the corresponding PH Rolls is successful, the Trooper removes a Wound and cancels their Unconscious State. In this case, even if the Trooper passes every PH Roll, they only remove one single Wound.
