{{effects}}
* The user ignores the [[WIP]]-3 MOD imposed by the [[Impersonation State|Impersonation-1 State]].
* If the user passes a [[Discover]] Roll against a Trooper in Impersonation-1 State, that Trooper's Impersonation State is canceled and their IMP-1 Marker is replaced with the corresponding Model.
* Users of a Biometric Visor ignore [[Surprise Attack]] MODs from attackers benefitting from [[Impersonation State | Impersonation]] or [[Holoecho State]]s, if they have [[LoF]] to the attacker. In addition, they also ignore Surprise Attack MODs from [[CC Attack]]s from those attackers even if they don't have LoF to the attacker.
