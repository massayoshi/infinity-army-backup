{{effects}}
* Reduces the -6 [[WIP]] MOD imposed by [[Impersonation State|Impersonation-1 State]] to 0.
* Users of a Biometric Visor ignore [[Surprise Attack]] MODs from attackers benefitting from [[Impersonation  State | Impersonation]] or [[Holoecho State]]s, if they have [[LoF]] to the attacker. In addition, they also ignore Surprise Attack MODs from [[CC Attack]]s from those attackers even if they don't have LoF to the attacker.
