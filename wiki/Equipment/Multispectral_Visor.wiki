{{skill-label | Obligatory }}
{{effects}}
* This Visor reduces MODs from [[Mimetism]], and from [[Visibility Zone]]s, to 0.

* When performing [[Discover]] against a target in [[Camouflaged State]], the user's [[WIP]] Roll is automatically a success.
* Users of a Multispectral Visor L3 ignore [[Surprise Attack]] MODs if they have [[LoF]] to the attacker. In addition, they also ignore Surprise Attack MODs from [[CC Attack]]s even if they don't have LoF to the attacker.
* Additionally, in the [[Active Turn]] the user may perform a [[BS Attack]] on a Camouflage Marker (CAMO) in LoF without making a previous Discover Roll, but they must apply the Mimetism MOD indicated on the Marker. However, the Cancellation clauses for Camouflaged State are applied as usual.
