{{requirements}}
* A TinBot grants its MODs or additional advantages as long as its owner is not in any [[Null]] State ([[Unconscious]], [[Dead]], [[Sepsitorized]], etc.) or Isolated State.
{{effects}}
* TinBots are pieces of Equipment, so they cannot be targeted by any Skill, even if they are represented by a [[Model]] or [[Token]]. 
* If the owner of a TinBot enters [[Dead State]], remove the TinBot from the game alongside its owner.
* A TinBot grants its owner with different MODs, Special Skills, or pieces of Equipment. The player will apply the one specified next to the TinBot, in the [[Unit Profile]].
* If the owner of a TinBot is part of a [[Fireteam]], every member of the Fireteam will benefit from the TinBot. 
* If the members of a Fireteam have more than one TinBot between them that grants the same advantages, they can only use '''one''' of them per declared Order or ARO. If the TinBots grant different MODs for the same advantage, only the most advantageous MOD may be used.

a = A: TinBots are purely aesthetic and are just reminders of the Trooper's equipment, even if represented by a Token or Model. A Trooper's TinBots are not placed on the table until the Trooper is placed on the table as a Model. |
