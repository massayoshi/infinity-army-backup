* Deactivator allows the user, by passing a Normal [[WIP]] Roll, to deactivate Enemy Equipment or Deployable Weapons ([[Mines]], [[FastPanda]]s, [[CrazyKoala]]s...) within LoF.
* The WIP Roll only applies MODs for [[Range]], but not those from Special Skills (for example [[Mimetism]]), or [[Cover]].
* If the user passes the WIP Roll, the Enemy Equipment or weapon is removed from play.
