In Suppressive Fire, the soldier is more intent on saturating the combat area with gunfire, rather than actually inflicting damage to the enemy forces. 

The goal of Suppressive Fire is to restrict the capacity of the enemy forces to maneuver or successfully return fire, by unleashing a barrage of overwhelming gunfire upon them.
