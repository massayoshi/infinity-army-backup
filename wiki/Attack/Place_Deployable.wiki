Common Skill that allows placement of [[Deployable Weapon]]s, pieces of Equipment, and [[Peripheral#Peripheral_.28Ancillary.29 | Peripherals]] on the game table. The Deployable item must be represented by a Token, or alternatively by a Model, a Model or by a scenery piece of the same Silhouette.

{{css_skillbox |greenyellow| PLACE DEPLOYABLE | SHORT SKILL / ARO }}
{{skill-label | Attack }}
{{requirements}}
* Have a Weapon or piece of Equipment with the [[Deployable]] Label, or have a [[Peripheral#Peripheral_.28Ancillary.29 | Peripheral (Ancillary)]].
* In the Reactive Turn, [[LoF]] to the Active Trooper is required.
{{effects}}
* Allows the user to place a single Token or Model on the game table to represent the weapon, piece of Equipment, or Peripheral (Ancillary), with no Roll required.
* In the '''Active Turn''', the Trooper can deploy the Token or Model in [[Silhouette contact]] or, if he moved, in Silhouette contact with any part of his route. In the '''Reactive Turn''', the Trooper must deploy it in Silhouette contact.
* The Token must be fully supported by the surface it is placed on and cannot be placed on a vertical surface.
* The Token representing the weapon, piece of Equipment, or Peripheral (Ancillary) is placed at the '''[[Conclusion]]''' of the Order in which the Trooper declared this Skill. The enemy may only react against the Trooper that declares the Skill, not against the weapon, piece of Equipment, or Peripheral (Ancillary) that is placed on the table during that Order or ARO.
* Once the Token has been placed on the table, the weapon, piece of Equipment, or Peripheral (Ancillary) is activated and can be used in subsequent Orders/AROs.
* A weapon, piece of Equipment, or Peripheral (Ancillary) deployed on the battlefield will remain in play until the end of the game, until it is destroyed, or in the case of Deployable Weapons until detonated.
* When placing a Weapon, piece of Equipment, or Peripheral (Ancillary), Deployment rules must be observed and, in the case of playing a scenario, the Deployment restrictions it may impose.
* '''Restriction:''' A Deployable Weapon cannot be placed if there is an enemy [[Camouflaged | Camouflage Marker]] inside its [[Trigger Area]]. This restriction does not apply if there is a valid, non-camouflaged enemy inside the Trigger Area, or an [[Intuitive Attack]] was made.

=== Deployable and Perimeter ===
* Weapons and pieces of Equipment with both the Deployable and the [[Perimeter]] Traits have the following additional rules:
** When players declare the Place Deployable Common Skill, they place the Weapon or piece of Equipment totally inside the [[Zone of Control]] of the Trooper, instead of placing it in Silhouette contact.
** It must be possible to draw a path from the Trooper to the Perimeter Weapon's location. The path cannot be blocked by an impassable obstacle (for example a wall of infinite height, a closed door or sealed room...) or a gap too small for the [[Silhouette Template]] of the Perimeter Weapon to pass through.
** The Weapon or piece of Equipment will be placed at the [[Conclusion]] of the Order.
** Once the Model or Token is on the table, the Weapon or piece of Equipment becomes a static element.

Deployable weapons and pieces of Equipment and Peripherals (Ancillary) have their own profiles with Attributes and can be designated as targets in games.

{{greybox-start | Deployable and Perimeter Example }}
{{image | name=n5/eng-place-deployable-example-1.jpg | style=fullborder }}

During her Active Turn, a Hacker wants to declare a [[Comms Attack]] against an enemy who is clearly outside her [[Hacking Area]].
To avoid the [[Camouflaged]] Marker that stands in her way, she declares Place Deployable and places her [[FastPanda]] ([[Repeater]], [[Deployable]], [[Perimeter]]) as shown in the picture.

Once placed on the game table, when the Order concludes, the FastPanda is activated, and its [[Repeater]] may be used to Attack the enemy.
