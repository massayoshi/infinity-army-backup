{{skill-label | Attack }}

{{requirements}}
* The target must be within the user's [[LoF]] or [[ZoC]].
* A Deactivator can only target enemy [[Deployable Weapon]]s and Deployable pieces of Equipment that have been deployed on the game table, but never [[Camouflaged | Camouflage Markers]].
{{effects}}
* The user of Deactivator, by passing a [[Normal]] [[WIP]] Roll, may deactivate the enemy Deployable Weapon or Deployable piece of Equipment ([[Mines]], [[FastPanda]]s, [[WildParrot]]s, [[Deployable Cover]], [[Deployable Repeater]]s, [[Armed Turret]]s, etc.).
* '''Restriction:''' Passing the WIP Roll does not prevent the enemy Deployable Weapon or Deployable piece of Equipment from triggering during the current Order.
* The WIP Roll only applies MODs for [[Range]], but not those from Special Skills (for example [[Mimetism]]), or [[Cover]].
* If the user passes the WIP Roll, the enemy Deployable weapon or Deployable piece of Equipment is removed from the game table.
