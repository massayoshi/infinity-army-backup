A berserk Trooper is overcome with bloodlust or such single-minded determination that all concern for personal safety is cast aside in an attempt to annihilate the opponent.

{{requirements}}
* The target must be within the user's [[LoF]] when declaring this Skill.
{{effects}}
Allows the user to declare [[Move]] + [[CC Attack]] as a single Long Skill, with the following special effects:
* The Move can be as far as '''both values of his [[MOV]] Attribute added together''' to reach [[Silhouette contact]] with the target.
* If, when measuring to find where the Trooper can move, they cannot reach Silhouette contact with the target, the Trooper will perform an [[Idle]] and therefore will neither Move, nor perform the CC Attack.
* If a MOD appears between brackets, for example Berserk (+3), that MOD is applied to the CC Attack.
* This CC Special Skill may be declared without being in Silhouette contact with a target.
* Although Berserk is a Long Skill, when performing it the user may still apply any (+1 SD) MOD they have.

{{remember-start}}
As Berserk is a Long Skill, when it is declared the player must indicate both the route of the Basic Short Skill Move and the target of the CC Attack before his opponent declares any [[ARO]]s.

== [[Fireteams in the Active Turn | Fireteams]] and Berserk ==
{{advice}}
If the Fireteam Leader declares the [[Berserk]] Skill, only the Fireteam members who have that Skill will be able to declare and perform it, the rest of the Troopers will declare and perform an [[Idle]].
