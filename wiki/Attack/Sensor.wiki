Hyper-developed senses and sophisticated tracking technology are the two sides of the Sensor coin. Either way, the bottom line is the same: the ability to uncover hidden threats in one's immediate surroundings.

* By declaring Sensor, the user may make a [[Normal]] [[WIP]]+6 Roll (without applying [[Range]] or [[Mimetism]] MODs) to simultaneously [[Discover]] all enemy Troopers, Weapons or pieces of Equipment in the [[Hidden Deployment State | Hidden Deployment]] or [[Camouflaged]] States, who are inside the user's Zone of Control.
* The user does not need [[LoF]] to a target, or to designate a target at all.
* Enemies with the [[Camouflage]] Special Skill cannot regain Camouflaged State inside the [[Zone of Control]] of the user.
* Sensor also grants its user, automatically and without making Rolls or spending Orders, a +6 MOD to WIP when declaring Discover against [[Camouflaged | Camouflage Markers]].
