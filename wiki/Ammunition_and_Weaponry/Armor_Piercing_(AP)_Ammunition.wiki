A type of ammunition designed to penetrate even the toughest armor plating. 

{{skillbox |black| ARMOR PIERCING (AP) AMMUNITION | }}
{{Roll}}
*After a successful attack using AP Ammunition, the target must make a [[Saving Roll]] per impact suffered, using half his [[ARM]] or [[BTS]] value ([[ARM]]/2 or [[BTS]]/2) as specified by the weapon being used. 
{{effects}}
*AP Ammunition reduces the [[ARM]] or [[BTS]] value of its target to half of its original value, rounding up. Consequently, any [[ARM]] or [[BTS]] above 0 cannot be reduced below 1. 
*Each [[Saving Roll]] failed against AP Ammunition causes the target to lose one point from his [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute.
*[[Critical]] hits with AP Ammunition cause the targets to make an additional [[Saving Roll]], applying their halved [[ARM]] or [[BTS]] value.

q = Q: How does Bioimmunity interact with Ammunition and Traits that reduce the Saving Roll Attribute, for example AP or E/M Ammunition, or ARM=0? |
a = A: AP Ammunition is tied to the Saving Roll Attribute listed in a weaponâ€™s profile. If Bioimmunity is used to make the Saving Roll against a different Attribute, that Attribute will not be halved.
In the same way, if Bioimmunity is used against a hit by E/M Ammunition to make the Saving Rolls against ARM, the ARM value will not be halved.
The ARM=0 Trait only applies if the Saving Roll is made against the ARM Attribute, and vice-versa for the BTS=0 Trait. |
