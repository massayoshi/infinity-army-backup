{{roll}}
* After a successful attack using AP Ammunition, the target must make a [[Saving Roll]] per hit suffered, using half his [[ARM]] or [[BTS]] value (ARM/2 or BTS/2) as specified by the weapon being used.
{{effects}}
* AP Ammunition reduces the ARM or BTS value of its target to half of its original value, rounding up. Consequently, any ARM or BTS above 0 cannot be reduced below 1.
* Each [[Saving Roll]] failed against AP Ammunition inflicts 1 [[Wound]] on the target.
* [[Critical]] hits with AP Ammunition cause the targets to make an additional Saving Roll, applying their halved ARM or BTS value.
