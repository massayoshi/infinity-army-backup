{{Activation}}
*The Trooper suffered a successful Attack or Effect using an [[Ammunition]], [[Hacking Program]] or a game condition or Scenario Special Rule, capable of causing this state. 
{{Effects}}
*Troopers in Immobilized-A State cannot declare any Skill or ARO, except '''[[Dodge]]''', applying a -6 [[PH]] [[MOD]]. {{seefaq | State MODs are cumulative.}}
*Automatic [[Special Skills]] and [[Equipment]] continue to work, but the Trooper must still respect all declaration restrictions. 
*Troopers in Immobilized-A State continue to provide Orders to their [[Order Pool]].
{{Cancellation}}
*The affected Trooper may cancel this state via a successful Normal or Face to Face [[Dodge]] Roll, applying the -6 [[PH]] [[MOD]] provided by this state.
*A Trooper with the '''[[Engineer]]''' Special Skill (or an equivalent Skill) may cancel Immobilized-A State by spending one Short Skill of an Order while in [[Silhouette contact]] with the affected Trooper, and passing a Normal '''[[WIP]]''' Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario).


== Example ==
{{greybox-start | BS Attack Against a Trooper in Immobilized-A State}}
{{image | name=eng-bs-attack-vs-imm-a.jpg | style=512border }}

Let's suppose a Zhanshi is in Immobilized-A state. 

A Betatrooper spends an Order, declares Move + BS Attack, and uses their Spitfire against the Zhanshi. 

In this state, the Zhanshi may only declare [[Dodge]] as their ARO, with a -6 MOD.

Therefore, a Face to Face Roll of 4 Spitfire shots is made against 1 Dodge Roll. 

The Zhanshi will apply the following MODs to the Dodge Roll:

: -6 for Immobilized-A.

With a PH Attribute of 10, the Success Value (SV) will be 10 - 6 = 4.

The Betatrooper will apply the following MODs to the BS Attack Roll:

: +3 for Range.
: -3 for Cover.

With a BS Attribute of 13, the Success Value (SV) will be 13 + 3 - 3 = 13.

Resolution:

The Zhanshi loses the Face to Face Roll, so he suffers 3 Spitfire hits, since the 4th (with a result of 14) is a miss for the Betatrooper.
