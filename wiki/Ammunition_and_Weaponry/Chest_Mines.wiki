{{effects}}
* This weapon has two Modes of use:
** In '''BS Weapon Mode''', Chest Mines function as a [[Direct Template Weapon]], not applying the Mines rule.
** In '''CC Weapon Mode''', Chest Mines function as a [[CC Weapon]], not applying the Mines rule. If the user wins the [[Face to Face Roll]], the Chest Mine will affect all enemy Troopers in [[Silhouette contact]] with its bearer. This weapon cannot be used in CC if there are [[allied]] troopers in Silhouette contact with its bearer.
* The [[Disposable]] (2) Trait is shared between all Modes. The bearer of this weapon has only two uses available, no matter which Modes are used.
* The detonation of a Chest Mine doesn't affect its bearer.
