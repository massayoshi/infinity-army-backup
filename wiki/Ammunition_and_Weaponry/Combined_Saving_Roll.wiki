Some weapons in Infinity N4 may require a [[Saving Roll]] against different Attributes.

These weapons will indicate the different combined Attributes with the plus sign ([[ARM]]+[[BTS]] for example).

When a [[Critical]] is obtained with a weapon with a Combined Saving Roll, the target must make an additional Saving Roll against the ARM Attribute. 

{{greybox-start | Examples of Combined Saving Rolls }}
A hit from a Plasma Carbine forces its target to make two Saving Rolls, one against the ARM Attribute and the other against the BTS Attribute. 

A Critical from the Plasma Carbine forces its target to make an additional Saving Roll against the ARM Attribute. Therefore, the target will perform two Saving Rolls against the ARM Attribute and one against the BTS Attribute.

q = Q: How does Immunity (Total) interact with Plasma Weapons, and with Sepsitor? |
a = A: Immunity (Total) cancels the special effects of any ammunition, considering them Normal Ammunition. Plasma weapons use Normal Ammunition, but their Saving Roll is ARM+BTS, so one ARM and one BTS Saving Roll will be made. Sepsitor should have the State: Sepsitorized Trait, and therefore does not work against targets with Immunity (Total). |
