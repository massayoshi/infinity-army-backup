A high value ammunition that causes severe damage to the target.

{{skillbox |black| T2 AMMUNITION | }}
{{Roll}}
* After a successful attack using T2 Ammunition, the target must make a [[Saving Roll]] per impact suffered.
{{effects}}
* Each failed [[Saving Roll]] against T2 Ammunition causes the target to lose '''two points''' from his [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute.
* [[Critical]] hits with T2 Ammunition cause the target to make an additional [[Saving Roll]]. Failing this additional Saving Roll causes the target to lose only '''one point''' from their Wounds/STR Attribute. It is important to indicate, before performing the Saving Rolls, which die corresponds to the Saving Roll from the impact and which die to the additional Saving Roll from the Critical effect.
