A high-value ammunition that causes severe damage to the target.

{{css_skillbox |black| T2 AMMUNITION }}
{{roll}}
* After a successful attack using T2 Ammunition, the target must make a [[Saving Roll]] per hit suffered.
{{effects}}
* Each failed Saving Roll against T2 Ammunition inflicts 2 [[Wound]]s on the target.
* [[Critical]] hits with T2 Ammunition cause the target to make an additional Saving Roll. Failing this additional Saving Roll inflicts '''only 1''' additional Wound on the target. It is important to indicate, before performing the Saving Rolls, which die corresponds to the Saving Roll from the hit and which die to the additional Saving Roll from the Critical effect.
