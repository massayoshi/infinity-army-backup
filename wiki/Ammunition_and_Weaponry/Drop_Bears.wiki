"Drop Bear" is the colloquial name used in the military for a thrown version of the Mine. The operator of this weapon can throw it, even over an obstacle, or alternatively can deploy it within arm's reach like an old-fashioned mine.

{{css_skillbox |black| DROP BEAR }}
{{effects}}
This weapon has two modes of use, Deployable Mode and BS Mode:
* '''Drop Bear (Deployable Mode):'''
** In this Mode, Drop Bears work just like a [[Mines | Mine]], so are placed with the [[Place Deployable]] or [[Intuitive Attack]] Common Skills, except that a Mine Token [Mine (-3)] is placed instead of a Camouflage Marker.
* '''Drop Bear (BS Mode):'''
** You do not need a target to throw a Drop Bear as a [[BS Weapon]], simply choose the desired location and make the corresponding Roll. If you pass the Roll, the Drop Bear is successfully deployed and becomes a Mine, placing a Mine Token [MINE (-3)] in the [[Conclusion]] step of the Order.
** A Drop Bear cannot detonate during the Order it is used in BS Mode.
** In BS Weapon Mode, Drop Bears cannot be placed where there is an enemy [[Camouflaged | Camouflage Marker]] inside its [[Trigger Area]]. This restriction does not apply if there is a valid, non-camouflaged enemy inside the Trigger Area
* The [[Disposable]] (3) Trait is shared between all Modes. The bearer of this weapon has only three uses available, no matter which Modes are used.
