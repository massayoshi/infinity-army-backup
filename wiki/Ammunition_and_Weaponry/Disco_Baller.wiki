{{css_skillbox |black| DISCO BALL }}
{{skill-label | BS Attack, Disposable (2), Targetless. }}
{{effects}}
* You do not need a target for the Disco Baller, simply choose the desired location and make the corresponding Roll. If you pass the Roll, a Disco Ball is successfully deployed in the location, placing a Disco Ball Miniature or Token in the [[Conclusion]] step of the Order.
* After placing the Disco Ball, place an '''[[Eclipse]]''' Special Ammo Circular Template, centered on the Disco Ball. 
* At the start of the [[States Phase]], the Disco Ball deactivates. Remove the Circular Template.
* Deactivated Disco Balls can be reactivated using the Activate Disco Ball Skill. 
* A deployed Disco Ball remains on the table until the end of the game, or until it is destroyed.
