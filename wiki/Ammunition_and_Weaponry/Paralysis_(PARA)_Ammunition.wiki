This ammunition has been specially designed not to cause any real harm, but it is powerful enough to immobilize any adversary.

{{skillbox |black| PARALYSIS (PARA) AMMUNITION | }}
{{skill-label | Non-Lethal }}
{{Roll}}
*After a successful attack using Paralysis (PARA) Ammunition, the target must make a [[PH]]-6 Roll per impact suffered. {{seefaq | This Roll is a Saving Roll.}}
{{effects}}
*If the target fails the [[PH]]-6 [[Roll]], it enters [[Immobilized-A]] state. Place an Immobilized-A Token (IMM A) next to it. 
*[[Critical]] hits with Paralysis (PARA) Ammunition cause the target to make an additional [[PH]]-6 [[Roll]].
*This Ammunition has no effect on targets that have no PH [[Attribute]]. In this case the target will not roll and will ignore the effects of this Ammunition.


==Example==
{{greybox-start | PARA Ammunition}}
In the case of the Heavy Riotstopper, a Direct Template weapon that uses PARA ammunition, if it hits a target with a PH Attribute of 12, this Trooper will have to make a PH-6 Roll (12 – 6 = 6). Therefore, any result equal to or lower than 6 will mean that the target avoids entering Immobilized-A state. Otherwise, an Immobilized-A state Token will have to be placed in contact with the target’s base.
