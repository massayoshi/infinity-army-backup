{{n5-section-ammo-and-weaponry}}


This ammunition has been specially designed not to cause any real harm, but it is powerful enough to immobilize any adversary.

{{css_skillbox |black| PARALYSIS (PARA) AMMUNITION }}
{{roll}}
* After a successful attack using Paralysis (PARA) Ammunition, the target must make a [[Saving Roll]] ([[PH]]-6) per hit suffered.
{{effects}}
* If the target fails the PH-6 Roll, it enters [[Immobilized-A State]]. Place an Immobilized-A Marker (IMM A) next to it.
* [[Critical]] hits with Paralysis (PARA) Ammunition cause the target to make an additional PH-6 Roll.
* This Ammunition has no effect on targets that have no PH [[Attribute]]. In that case, the target will not roll and will ignore the effects of this Ammunition.

==Example==
{{greybox-start | PARA Ammunition}}
In the case of the Heavy Riotstopper, a Direct Template weapon that uses PARA ammunition, if it hits a target with a PH Attribute of 12, this Trooper will have to make a PH-6 Roll (12 – 6 = 6). Therefore, any result equal to or lower than 6 will mean that the target avoids entering Immobilized-A State. Otherwise, an Immobilized-A State Token will have to be placed in contact with the target’s base.
