In Infinity some weapons can combine the effects of more than one type of Ammunition. These weapons will indicate the different types of Ammunition they combine with the plus sign (AP+DA for example). 

Combined Ammunition works as a single Ammunition that adds the effects of the different Ammunitions that compose it. 

Therefore, when obtaining a Critical with Combined Ammunition, the target must perform an additional [[Saving Roll]]. The additional [[Saving Roll]] will apply the effects of the different types Ammunition that compose it, if applicable.


{{greybox-start | Examples of Combined Ammunition}}
An Impact with AP+DA Ammunition forces the target to perform two [[Saving Rolls]] (due to the DA Ammunition) with the ARM or BTS Attribute halved (due to the AP Ammunition).

A Critical with AP+DA Ammunition forces the target to perform one extra [[Saving Roll]] with the ARM or BTS Attribute halved. Consequently, the target must perform three [[Saving Rolls]] with the ARM or BTS Attribute halved, for each Critical with AP+DA Ammunition (two due to the DA Ammunition and one due to the Critical). 

A Critical with AP+EXP Ammunition forces the target to perform one extra [[Saving Roll]] with the ARM or BTS Attribute halved. The target must therefore perform four [[Saving Rolls]] with the ARM or BTS Attribute halved for each Critical with AP+EXP Ammunition (three due to the EXP Ammunition and one due to the Critical).
