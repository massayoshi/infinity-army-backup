Eclipse Ammunition is a variant of Smoke Ammunition designed to block the effect of Multispectral Visors.

{{effects}}
* Eclipse Ammunition works in exactly the same way as [[Smoke Ammunition]], but the [[Zero Visibility Zone]] it generates also affects [[Multispectral Visor]]s, preventing them from drawing [[LoF]], regardless of their Level.
* Performing an Attack with a weapon with Eclipse Ammunition allows the user to make a Face to Face Roll against all enemy '''Attacks that require a Roll and LoF, and whose LoF''' passes through the [[Reflective]] Zero Visibility Zone generated by the Template. 
{{update | 1.3, Nov 2022}}
* {{erratahighlight}}If a Trooper with a Multispectral Visor is the target of a BS Attack into, through, or out of this Zero Visibility Zone, their Multispectral Visor cannot reduce the MODs of the resulting Poor Visibility Zone.{{erratahighlight-end}}

{{important-start}}
The Area of Effect of a Template may affect Allied Troopers as long as the Template lacks the Damage Attribute and causes no State. {{seefaq | Attacks with no Damage value that do not inflict States do not cause Guts Rolls.}}

Multispectral Visors are affected by the Reflective Trait, so Troopers equipped with this piece of Equipment also perform Face to Face Rolls against weapons with Eclipse Ammunition.
