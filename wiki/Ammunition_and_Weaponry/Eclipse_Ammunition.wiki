Eclipse Ammunition is a variant of Smoke Ammunition designed to block the effect of Multispectral Visors.

{{effects}}
* Eclipse Ammunition works in exactly the same way as [[Smoke Ammunition]], but the [[Zero Visibility Zone]] it generates also affects [[Multispectral Visor]]s, preventing them from drawing [[LoF]], regardless of their Level.
* Performing an Attack with a weapon with Eclipse Ammunition allows the user to make a [[Face to Face Roll]] against all enemy Attacks that require a Roll and LoF, and whose LoF passes through the [[Reflective]] Zero Visibility Zone generated by the Template.
* If a Trooper with a Multispectral Visor is the target of a [[BS Attack]] into, through, or out of this Zero Visibility Zone, their Multispectral Visor cannot reduce the MODs of the resulting [[Poor Visibility Zone]].

{{remember-start}}
The Area of Effect of a Template may affect Allied Troopers as long as the Template lacks the PS Attribute and causes no State.

Multispectral Visors are affected by the Reflective Trait, so Troopers equipped with this piece of Equipment also perform Face to Face Rolls against weapons with Eclipse Ammunition.

'''[[Terrain and Scenery Structures#Special Terrain | Area of Effect of Special Terrain Zones]]'''<br>
In Infinity, the [[Area of Effect]] of a Special Terrain zone is the area in where its special effects are applied. Any Trooper in [[Silhouette contact]] with a Special Terrain zone, or whose base or [[Silhouette Template]] is covered at least partially by a Special Terrain zone, is equally affected by the Effects of the zone.
