{{effects}}
* Eclipse Ammunition works in exactly the same way as [[Smoke Ammunition]], but the [[Zero Visibility Zone]] it generates also affects [[Multispectral Visor]]s, preventing them from drawing [[LoF]], regardless of their Level.
* Performing an Attack with a weapon with Eclipse Ammunition allows the user to make a Face to Face Roll against all enemy '''Attacks that require a Roll and LoF, and whose LoF''' passes through the [[Reflective]] Zero Visibility Zone generated by the Template. 



{{important-start}}
The Area of Effect of a Template may affect Allied Troopers as long as the Template lacks the Damage Attribute and causes no State. {{seefaq | Attacks with no Damage value that do not inflict States do not cause Guts Rolls.}}

Multispectral Visors are affected by the Reflective Trait, so Troopers equipped with this piece of Equipment also perform Face to Face Rolls against weapons with Eclipse Ammunition.
