A type of ammunition devised to incapacitate its target without killing it.

{{css_skillbox |black| STUN AMMUNITION }}
{{roll}}
* After a successful attack with Stun Ammunition, the target must make one [[Saving Roll]] per hit suffered.
{{effects}}
* A failed Saving Roll against Stun Ammunition causes the target to enter [[Stunned State]]. Place a Stunned State Token (STUNNED) next to it.
* Additionally, failing the Saving Roll causes the target to automatically fail the subsequent [[Guts Roll]] for having survived an Attack, unless he has the [[Courage]] Special Skill or an equivalent.
* [[Critical]] hits with Stun Ammunition cause the target to make an additional Saving Roll.
