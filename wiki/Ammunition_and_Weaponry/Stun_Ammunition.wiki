A type of ammunition devised to incapacitate its target without killing it.

{{skillbox |black| STUN AMMUNITION | }}
{{skill-label | Non-Lethal }}
{{Roll}}
* After a successful attack with Stun Ammunition, the target must make '''two''' [[Saving Rolls]] per impact suffered.
{{effects}}
* A failed [[Saving Roll]] against Stun Ammunition causes the target to enter [[Stunned State]]. Place a Stunned State Token (STUNNED) next to it.
* Additionally, failing the [[Saving Roll]] causes the target to automatically fail the subsequent [[Guts Roll]] for having survived an Attack, unless he has the [[Courage]] Special Skill or an equivalent.
* [[Critical]] hits with Stun Ammunition cause the target to make an additional [[Saving Roll]].
