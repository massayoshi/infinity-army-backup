{{n5-section-ammo-and-weaponry}}


This mobile weapons platform has been designed to be deployed on the battlefield at  a distance, acting as a Mine with E/M Special Ammunition.

{{css_skillbox |black| WILDPARROT }}
{{effects}}
* These weapons are placed with the [[Place Deployable]] or [[Intuitive Attack]] Common Skills, always applying the [[Place Deployable#Deployable and Perimeter | Deployable and Perimeter]] rule.
* Therefore, when players deploy this weapon, they place the WildParrot totally inside the [[Zone of Control]] of the Trooper, instead of placing it in [[Silhouette contact]].
* Deployed WildParrots work like E/M [[Mines]], except that a WildParrot Token or Model is placed instead of a Camouflage Marker.

Once deployed, WildParrots work like '''E/M [[Mines]]'''.
