Smoke Ammunition is a non-lethal ammunition used to block enemy lines of fire, allowing allied forces to advance and maneuver.

{{css_skillbox |black| SMOKE AMMUNITION }}
{{effects}}
* Smoke Ammunition generates a [[Zero Visibility Zone]] (see: Special Terrain, [[Visibility Conditions]]) the size of a Circular Template and with infinite height.
* The Smoke Template remains on the table until the start of the [[States Phase]].
* Smoke Ammunition is a non-offensive ammunition, so it does not require an enemy or, in fact, any trooper at all as a target, and can be thrown at any point on the table.
* Performing an Attack with a weapon with Smoke Ammunition allows the user to make a [[Face to Face Roll]] against '''all enemy Attacks that require a Roll and [[LoF]]''', and whose LoF passes through the Zero Visibility Zone generated by the Smoke Template.
* [[Critical]] hits with Smoke Ammunition have no additional effect, other than winning the Face to Face Roll, if applicable.
* If the Trooper is making a Face to Face Roll against several Attacks, he will need to win every single Face to Face Roll in order to leave the Smoke Template on the table. If he loses any of them (or fails an unopposed [[Normal Roll]]) the Smoke Template is removed in the [[Effects step]] of the Order.
* Any enemy in the [[Area of Effect]] of the Smoke Template that declares a [[Dodge]] ARO will make a Normal Roll, not a Face to Face Roll against the Smoke user.

{{important-start}}
The [[Area of Effect]] of a Template can affect [[Allied]] Troopers as long as the Template has no PS Attribute and does not inflict any State.

[[Multispectral Visor]]s can draw Line of Fire through Zero Visibility Zones, so Troopers equipped with this piece of Equipment do not perform Face to Face Rolls against Smoke Ammunition.

{{important-start}}
[[Template Weapon]]s and their [[Area of Effect]] are affected by Scenery Elements.

As the Area of Effect of the Smoke Templates has infinite height, they form a cylinder starting from the Template upwards that will be affected by scenery elements. The Area of Effect will be cut horizontally and vertically by such scenery elements (see the example).

The Active Trooper declares [[Move]], Troopers 1, 2, and 3 declare [[BS Attack]] as their [[ARO]]s

As the second half of their Order, the Active Trooper throws a Smoke Grenade, placing a Template on the gaming table to determine which Troopers will be affected.

Trooper 1 is not affected because his [[LoF]] does not cross the Template, so he makes a [[Normal Roll]] instead of a [[Face to Face Roll]].

The LoF of Trooper 2 does cross the Circular Template, so he will perform a Face to Face Roll between his BS and the Active Trooper's PH. Trooper 3, despite the fact that his LoF crosses the Circular Template, will perform a Normal Roll thanks to his [[Multispectral Visor]], which allows him to draw LoF through the Smoke.

The Circular Smoke Template will remain on the table until the [[States Phase]] if the Active Trooper wins the Face to Face Roll against Trooper 2.

As shown in the picture, the [[Area of Effect]] of Smoke Grenades is affected by Scenery Elements. In this situation, Trooper is not inside the Smoke Template due to the balcony that is cutting off the Area of Effect of the Circular Template.

'''[[Terrain and Scenery Structures#Special Terrain | Area of Effect of Special Terrain Zones]]'''<br>
In Infinity, the [[Area of Effect]] of a Special Terrain zone is the area in where its special effects are applied. Any Trooper in [[Silhouette contact]] with a Special Terrain zone, or whose base or [[Silhouette Template]] is covered at least partially by a Special Terrain zone, is equally affected by the Effects of the zone.
