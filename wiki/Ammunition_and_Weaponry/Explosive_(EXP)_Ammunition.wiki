{{Roll}}
*After a successful attack using Explosive (EXP) Ammunition, the target must make '''three''' [[Saving Rolls]] per impact suffered.
{{effects}}
*Each [[Saving Roll]] failed against EXP Ammunition causes the target to lose one point from his [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute.
*The three [[Saving Rolls]] are mandatory, even if the target fails one of them or falls [[Unconscious]]. 
*[[Critical]] hits with Explosive Ammunition cause the target to make an additional [[Saving Roll]].


{{explain-start}}
For each Critical hit with EXP Ammunition, the target must make 4 Saving Rolls: 3 due to the impact with EXP Ammunition and 1 more due to the additional Saving Roll.
