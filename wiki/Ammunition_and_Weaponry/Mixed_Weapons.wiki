These are ranged weapons with Range MODS, while also having the CC Trait and, therefore, have a Melee Weapon Mode as well as a BS Weapon Mode.

== CC Throwing Weapon ==

The various types of CC Throwing Weapon are CC Weapons with two usage modes.

Throwing Mode uses the [[PH]] Attribute to make [[BS Attack]]s. Weapons used in this Mode are considered BS Weapons for all intents and purposes. On the other hand, CC Mode uses the [[CC]] Attribute to make [[CC Attack]]s in Close Combat.
