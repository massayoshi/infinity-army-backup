{{css_skillbox |black| ELECTROMAGNETIC (E/M) AMMUNITION | }}
{{Roll}}
* After a successful attack using E/M Ammunition, the target must make two [[Saving Roll]]s per hit suffered, using half his [[BTS]] value (BTS/2 x 2).
{{effects}}
* E/M Ammunition reduces the BTS value of its target to half of its original value, rounding up.
* A failed Saving Roll against E/M Ammunition causes the target to enter [[Isolated State]], placing an Isolated Token next to it, preventing it from receiving Orders from the [[Order Pool]].
* If, at the start of his following Active Turns, the Trooper is still Isolated, then he is considered to be [[Irregular]] and '''does not add his Order to that Turns Order Pool'''.
* If the target fails a Saving Roll and is Heavy Infantry ([[HI]]), a [[TAG]], a Remote ([[REM]]), or a Vehicle ([[VH]]), then it also enters [[Immobilized-B State]]. Place an Immobilized-B Token (IMM-B) next to it in addition to the Isolated Token.
* A Trooper who receives a hit from E/M Ammunition and fails the Saving Roll must make the usual [[Guts Roll]], if applicable.
** The exceptions to this are HIs, TAGs, Remotes, and Vehicles that, having failed the Saving Roll, are now Immobilized-B and cannot make Guts Rolls. Also, Troopers possessing the [[Courage]] Special Skill, or an equivalent, can ignore this rule.
* [[Critical]] hits with E/M Ammunition cause the target to make an additional Saving Roll, applying their halved BTS value.
