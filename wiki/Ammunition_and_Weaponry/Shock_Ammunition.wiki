This Ammunition is designed to kill rather than simply incapacitate enemy combatants.

{{skillbox |black| SHOCK AMMUNITION | }}
{{Roll}}
* After a successful attack using Shock Ammunition, the target must make a [[Saving Roll]] per impact suffered.
{{effects}}
* Each [[Saving Roll]] failed against Shock Ammunition causes the target to lose one point from his [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute.
* [[Critical]] hits with Shock Ammunition cause the target to make an additional [[Saving Roll]].
* Any failed [[Saving Rolls]] against Shock Ammunition will also cancel any type of [[Unconscious State]] the target is in, or has entered during this Order, and the target will pass directly to [[Dead State]].


{{remember-start}}
The main types of Unconscious States are:
* [[Unconscious]]
* [[Shasvastii-Embryo]]
* [[Dogged]] (Special Skill)
* [[No Wound Incapacitation]] (Special Skill)
All their special effects are cancelled by Shock Ammunition and those Troopers pass directly to [[Dead State]].
