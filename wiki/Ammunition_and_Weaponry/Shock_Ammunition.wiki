This Ammunition is designed to kill rather than simply incapacitate enemy combatants.

{{css_skillbox |black| SHOCK AMMUNITION }}
{{roll}}
* After a successful attack using Shock Ammunition, the target must make a [[Saving Roll]] per hit suffered.
{{effects}}
* Each Saving Roll failed against Shock Ammunition inflicts 1 [[Wound]] to its target.
* [[Critical]] hits with Shock Ammunition cause the target to make an additional Saving Roll.
* If the target has the '''[[VITA]] Attribute, with a value of 1''', any failed Saving Rolls against Shock Ammunition will also cancel any type of [[Unconscious State]] the target is in, or has entered during this Order, and the target passes directly to [[Dead State]].
{{css_skillbox-end}}


{{remember-start}}
Shock Ammunition affects Unconscious State and any Special Skills that affect a Trooper's Unconscious State:
* [[Unconscious]]
* [[Shasvastii]] and Shasvastii-Embryo
* [[Dogged]]
* [[No Wound Incapacitation]]
All their special effects are cancelled by Shock Ammunition and those Troopers pass directly to the [[Dead State]].
{{remember-end}}


{{see-also-start}}
The '''[[Explode]]''' Special Skill does not activate if the Trooper passes directly to [[Dead State]].
