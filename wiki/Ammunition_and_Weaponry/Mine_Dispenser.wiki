q = Q: When using Place Deployable and declaring where the Deployable will be placed, what happens if a Trooper moves into that space before the Conclusion of the Order? |
a = A: The Trooper that declared Place Deployable may place the Deployable in a different position (still following the Place Deployable rule), and if this is not possible, the Deployable will be lost.

This also applies to weapons that place a Deployable Weapon or Equipment on a successful Roll, such as Disco Ballers, Pitchers, and Drop Bears (BS Mode). |
