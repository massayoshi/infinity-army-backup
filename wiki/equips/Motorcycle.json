* Units equipped with a Motorcycle have two separate [[Unit Profile]]s.
* When a Trooper on a Motorcycle declares any Skill with the [[Movement Label]] and announces he will [[Dismount]], replace the mounted figure with a Motorcycle Token (MOTORCYCLE). Place the Trooper's Model in [[Silhouette contact]] with the Motorcycle Token, or measure his movement from the edge of the Token's base, as you prefer.
* A Motorcycle Token has the following Attributes:
{| class="wikitable-dark"
|-
! Name !! ARM !! BTS !! STR !! S
|-
| Motorcycle || 0 || 0 || 1 || 4
|}
* Troopers mounted on a Motorcycle cannot go [[Prone]].
* Troopers mounted on a Motorcycle cannot [[Climb]], or use [[ladders]].
* Troopers mounted on a Motorcycle cannot [[Jump]] vertically or diagonally upward, they can only Jump horizontally and vertically or diagonally downward.

A Trooper on a Motorcycle may drive up ramps and stairs as long as they respect the [[General Movement Rules]]. However, they cannot use ladders. 

Likewise, the General Movement Rules explain how the Trooper mounts and dismounts their Motorcycle.
