{{activation}}
* Automatic when deploying the Model on the table.
{{effects}}
* Players must consider a Trooper in Active Albedo State as being inside a [[White Noise Zone]], applying the Effects of this [[Special Terrain Zone]].
* However, the Effects of the White Noise Zone don't affect the bearer.
* This State has a limited duration:
** When the Trooper is deployed, an Albedo-A Token is placed next to it to indicate that they are equipped with Albedo. 
** During the [[States Phase]], the Albedo-A Token is removed and replaced with an Albedo-B Token. 
** Lastly, in the next States Phase, the Albedo-B Token is removed and the Trooper may no longer use Albedo for the rest of the game.
