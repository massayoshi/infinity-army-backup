{{requirements}}
* In the Active or Reactive Turn, the Escape System activates automatically at the end of any [[Order]] during which the [[TAG]] lost its last [[STR]] point.
{{effects}}
* The activation process of an Escape System has two steps:
** At the end of the Order during which the TAG lost its last STR point, place the TAG Pilot [[Model]] in [[Silhouette contact]] with the TAG Model.
** Then, remove the TAG Model and replace it with a [[Smoke]] Circular Template.
* If the TAG lost more STR points than it had remaining, the excess points are subtracted from the Pilot's profile.
* The activation process must always be completed, even if the Pilot is already [[Unconscious]] or [[Dead]], and even if the TAG is Immobilized (due to Hacking, Ammunition Effects or any other reason).
* A TAG equipped with an Escape System provides its Order to the player who fielded it until its Pilot enters a [[Null]] State (Unconscious, Dead, [[Sepsitorized]]...).
* If the Pilot would be vulnerable to [[Hacking]] or [[E/M Ammunition]], he cannot be Hacked, or affected by E/M, while its Model is not on the game table.


{{Remember-start}}
The ARM and BTS values of the TAG are always used to make Saving Rolls, until the Pilot Model is placed on the game table.

Activating the Escape System does not require the expenditure of any Orders, and therefore Enemies cannot react in any way to the ejection of the Pilot.

Always place the Smoke Circular Template, even if the Pilot lost all his Wounds and was ejected Dead.
