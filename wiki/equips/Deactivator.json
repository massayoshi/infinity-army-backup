{{requirements}}
* The user of this piece of Equipment must have [[LoF]] to the target.
* Deactivator may be used only against Enemy [[Deployable Equipment|Equipment]] and [[Deployable Weapon]]s deployed on the game table, and never against [[Camouflaged|Camouflage]] Markers.
{{effects}}
* Deactivator allows the user, by passing a Normal [[WIP]] Roll, to deactivate Enemy Equipment or Deployable Weapons ([[Mines]], [[FastPanda]]s, [[CrazyKoala]]s...) within LoF.
* The WIP Roll only applies MODs for [[Range]], but not those from Special Skills (for example [[Mimetism]]), or [[Cover]].
* If the user passes the WIP Roll, the Enemy Equipment or weapon is removed from play.
