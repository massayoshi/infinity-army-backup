* Repeaters extend the [[Hacking Area]] of all [[Hacker]]s in the same [[Army List]].
* Hackers '''within the [[Zone of Control]]''' of an '''enemy Repeater''' may use Hacking Programs against any enemy Hacker, but they will have to '''apply [[Firewall]] MODs (-3)'''. {{seefaq | This MOD only applies if using the enemy Repeater.}}
* There can be no reaction against a Repeater that is being used by an enemy Hacker, only against the Hacker, if possible.

[[Firewall]] imposes an additional MOD (-3, -6...) to the WIP Roll of the Trooper that declared the [[Comms Attack]] against a Trooper that benefits from a Firewall, for example if attacking through an enemy Repeater. 

The Trooper benefitting from a Firewall applies a -3 MOD to the Attack Damage of the Comms Attack, if a Saving Roll needs to be made.

Only the MODs of a single Firewall can be applied, even if the Trooper benefits from more than one. In the case of the Trooper benefitting from more than one Firewall, their player will decide which one to apply.
