{{skill-label | Comms Attack, Non-Lethal. }}
{{requirements}}
Troopers can only perform Zero Pain if at least one of these is true:
* They are the Active Trooper.
* In the Reactive Turn, if they are allowed to declare an [[ARO]].

{{effects}}
* '''In the Active or Reactive Turn''', this Program allows the user to make '''two''' [[WIP]] Rolls in a [[Face to Face Roll]] to evade all enemy [[Comms Attack]]s.
* A -3 WIP MOD is applied to the enemy Comms Attacks.
* If the user wins with either Roll, the Comms Attack fails, the user does not have to make any [[Saving Rolls]], and they avoid any Special Effects of the Attack.
