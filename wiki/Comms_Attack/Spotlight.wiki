{{effects}}
* In the Active Turn, this Program's [[Burst]] of 2 allows the user to perform two [[WIP]] Rolls, which can be distributed among one or more targets as usual.
* Each successful Roll, due to [[AP Ammunition]], forces the target to make a [[Saving Roll]] against their halved [[BTS]], with PS 5.
* Any failed Saving Roll causes the target to enter [[Targeted State]], placing a Targeted State Token (TARGETED) by them.
* A [[Critical]] with Spotlight forces its target to perform an additional Saving Roll, applying their halved BTS value.
* The range of this Program is the [[Hacker]]'s [[Hacking Area]].
