{{requirements}}
* The target may only be an [[enemy]] Trooper with the [[Hackable]] Characteristic ([[HI]], [[REM]], [[TAG]], [[VH]]...) or an enemy [[Hacker]].
{{effects}}
* In the Active Turn, this Program's [[Burst]] of 2 allows the user to perform two [[WIP]] Rolls, which can be distributed among one or more targets as usual.
* Each successful Roll, due to [[DA Ammunition]], forces the target to make two [[Saving Roll]]s against [[BTS]], with PS 7.
* Any failed Saving Roll causes the target to enter '''[[Immobilized-B State]]''', placing an Immobilized-B State Token (IMM-B) by them.
* A [[Critical]] with Carbonite forces its target to perform an additional Saving Roll.
* The range of this Program is the Hacker's [[Hacking Area]].
