{{requirements}}
* The target must be an [[enemy]] [[TAG]], or a TAG in [[Possessed State]].
{{effects}}
* '''In the Active or Reactive Turn''', this Program has a [[Burst]] of 1, allowing the user to perform one [[WIP]] Roll against the target.
* Each successful Roll, due to [[DA Ammunition]], forces the target to make two [[Saving Roll]]s against [[BTS]], with PS 4.
* Any failed Saving Roll causes the target to enter [[Possessed State]], placing a Possessed State Token (POS) by them. If this Program is used against a TAG in Possessed State, any failed Saving Roll cancels the target's Possessed State, causing them to enter [[Normal State]], and the Possessed State Token (POS) is removed.
* A [[Critical]] with Total Control forces its target to perform an additional Saving Roll.
* The range of this Program is the [[Hacker]]'s [[Hacking Area]].
