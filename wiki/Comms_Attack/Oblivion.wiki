{{css_skillbox |greenyellow| OBLIVION | SHORT SKILL / ARO }}
{{skill-label | Comms Attack, Non-Lethal. }}

{{requirements}}
* The target must be an [[enemy]] with the [[Hackable]] Characteristic ([[HI]], [[REM]], [[TAG]], [[VH]]...) or an enemy [[Hacker]].

{{effects}}
* In the Active Turn, this Program's [[Burst]] of 2 allows the user to perform two [[WIP]] Rolls, which can be distributed among one or more targets as usual.
* Each successful Roll, due to [[AP Ammunition]], forces the target to make a [[Saving Roll]] against their halved [[BTS]], with PS 4.
* Any failed Saving Roll causes the target to enter [[Isolated State]], placing an Isolated State Token (ISOLATED) by them.
* A [[Critical]] with Oblivion forces its target to perform an additional Saving Roll, applying their halved BTS value.
* The range of this Program is the Hacker's [[Hacking Area]].
