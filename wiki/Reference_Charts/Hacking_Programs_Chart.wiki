== Key to the Hacking Programs Quick Reference Chart ==

Each Hacking Program grants a series of [[MODs]] and advantages when used, that are reflected in charts listing the following information:

*'''Attack MOD.''' A MOD that is applied to the user's WIP Attribute.
* '''Opponent's MOD.''' A MOD that is applied to an enemy Trooper's Attribute when performing a Face to Face Roll.
* '''Damage.''' The value used to determine the Damage when applying a successful Hacking Program Roll. Unless otherwise stated, the Attribute used in the Saving Roll to resist Damage from a Hacking Program is BTS. 
* '''Burst.''' The number of dice the Active Player must roll when declaring the Hacking Program. When the [[B]] value is higher than 1, it may be concentrated on a single target or be divided among several targets.<br>Remember that in the Reactive Turn the [[B]] value is generally 1, unless modified by a rule or Skill.
* '''Target.''' The Troop Type that can be targeted by the Hacking Program.
* '''Type of Skill.''' Indicates the type of Skill (Entire Order, Short Skill, ARO, etc.) that must be spent to use the Hacking Program. 
* '''Special.''' Indicates the special effects that the Hacking Program's user may apply. This section may also indicate a State that will be imposed on the target, or the type of '''[[Ammunition]]''' and [[Traits]] that may apply.


{{remember-start}}
Unless otherwise stated, the range of every Program is always the Hacker's [[Hacking Area]].

*They act in the user's Hacking Area.
*They do not require LoF to act, unless the Hacking Program's own description states otherwise. 
{{n4list}}
* Only Troopers or Peripherals in Model form may be targeted by Hacking Programs.
{{n4end}}
* They benefit, if applicable, from the target's [[Targeted]] State.
