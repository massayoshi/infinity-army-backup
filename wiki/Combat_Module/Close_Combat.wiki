== Close Combat (CC) ==

Urban combat, attempting to take a building, or ship to ship space-boarding often occur in reduced spaces, which favors close combat with bladed weapons (knives, machetes, sabers, swords, claws, etc.) which we generically call Melee Weapons.


== Interacting with a Close Combat ==

Any Trooper in [[Silhouette]] contact with an [[Allied]] Model that is in the [[Engaged State]] may only declare [[CC Attack]], [[Dodge]] or other related Skills that may be used in CC. For example, in these circumstances declaring Skills such as [[Doctor]] or [[Engineer]] on a Trooper in Engaged State is not allowed.


== Movement Sequence and CC ==
{{greybox-start | Movement Sequence and CC}}
{{image | name=n5/eng-cc-movement.jpg | style=fullborder }}

Close Combat is often associated with a Movement, the most common game sequence in this case is the following:

'''Step 1:'''<br>
The Active Player (Trooper A) consumes an [[Order]] and declares [[Move]].

'''Step 2:'''<br>
The Reactive Player (Trooper B) declares [[CC Attack]] as their [[ARO]].

'''Step 3:'''<br>
The Active Player (Trooper A) declares CC Attack as the second Short Skill of the Order.

'''Step 4:'''<br>
The corresponding [[Face to Face Roll]] is performed. Face to Face Roll:
* Active Player: 1 Die in CC.
* Reactive Player: 1 Die in CC.

== CC Attack Modifiers (MOD) ==
Before performing the [[CC Attack]] Roll (or Rolls), the player must check every MOD they must apply. The MODs are:
* Close Combat against several enemies.
* Special Skills, Weapons and Equipment.


=== Close Combat With Multiple Troopers ===
This rule is applied when more than 2 Troopers are in [[Silhouette contact]] with the target and any of them is activated.

==== During the Active Turn ====

When declaring a [[CC Attack]], the Player must select '''one''' [[Trooper]] or [[Peripheral]] activated by the Order. '''That Trooper or Peripheral performs''' the [[CC Attack]] and has a +1 MOD to [[Burst]] (B) for each [[Allied]] Trooper or Peripheral that is '''not''' in a [[Null]] or [[Immobilized]] State and is in [[Silhouette contact]] with their target.

==== During the Reactive Turn ====

When declaring [[ARO]]s, if the Reactive player decides to declare [[CC Attack]] they must select '''only one''' Trooper or Peripheral in [[Silhouette contact]] with the target. The selected Trooper performs a CC Attack and has a +1 MOD to [[B]] '''for each [[Allied]] Trooper or Peripheral''' in Silhouette contact with the target. The MOD is only applied for those allies that are not in a [[Null]] or [[Immobilized]] State, and have not declared [[Dodge]], [[Idle]] or [[Reset]].


== Other Restrictions ==
* When in Close Combat it is only possible to declare [[Berserk]], [[CC Attack]], [[Dodge]], [[Idle]], [[Reset]], and Skills that specify that they can be used in Close Combat or in [[Engaged State]].
* The maximum number of Models that may be in [[Silhouette contact]] with a Model on a 25 mm base is 4.
* The maximum number of Models that may be in Silhouette contact with a Model on a 40 mm or larger base is 6.


== Examples ==
{{greybox-start | Close Combat Against Several Enemies, Active Turn}}
{{image | name=n5/eng-cc-example-1.jpg | style=fullborder }}

{{image | name=n5/eng-cc-example-2.jpg | style=fullborder }}

In the image we have a Fennec and a Lambda [[Doctor]] with his [[Peripheral]] (Servant) Yudbot.

'''Step 1:'''<br>
The Active Trooper (the Lambda) consumes an [[Order]] and declares [[Move]].

'''Step 2:'''<br>
The Reactive Trooper (the Fennec) declares a [[BS Attack]] against the Doctor as their [[ARO]].

'''Step 3:'''<br>
The Active Trooper declares [[CC Attack]]. The player chooses the Doctor to perform the CC Attack.

The Doctor obtains a +1[[B]] MOD for having his Peripheral (Servant) in [[Silhouette contact]] with his target.

'''Step 4:'''<br>
Measurements for the BS Attack are made and the dice are rolled. 

Face to Face Roll:
* Active Player: CC Attack with 2 Dice.
* Reactive Player: BS Attack with 1 Die.

{{greybox-start | Close Combat Against Several Enemies, Reactive Turn}}
In the Blue player's Active Turn, a [[Move]] + [[CC Attack]] Order is added to the previous example's melee:

'''Step 1:'''<br>
The Active Trooper (the Fennec) consumes an [[Order]] and declares [[Move]] to reach [[Silhouette contact]] with the [[Peripheral]] (Servant).

{{image | name=n5/eng-cc-example-3.jpg | style=fullborder }}

'''Step 2:'''<br>
Since the Troopers involved in a Close Combat do not have [[LoF]] outside Close Combat, they cannot declare [[BS Attack]]. Therefore, the Reactive Player's Troopers (Purple) can only declare [[CC Attack]], [[Reset]], [[Idle]], or [[Dodge]] with their Lambda or Peripheral (Servant).

They decide to declare [[CC Attack]] as an [[ARO]] with their Peripheral (Servant).

'''Step 3:'''<br>
As the second half of the Order, the Active Trooper declares [[CC Attack]].

The Fennec gets a +1[[B]] MOD thanks to his partner being in [[Silhouette contact]] with the [[Peripheral]] (Servant).

The Peripheral does not get a +1B MOD because its Controller is not in Silhouette contact with the Active Trooper.

'''Step 4:'''<br>
The corresponding Rolls are performed. 

Face to Face Roll:
* Active Player. CC Attack with 2 Dice.
* Reactive Player: CC Attack with 1 Die.

== Special Skills and Equipment ==

Certain [[Special Skill]]s, [[Weapons]], and [[Equipment]] impose [[MODs]] to [[CC Attack]] Rolls, as seen in the rulebook (see [[Special Skills]], Weaponry, and [[Equipment]], although it is recommended that these concepts be applied as they appear in the game).
