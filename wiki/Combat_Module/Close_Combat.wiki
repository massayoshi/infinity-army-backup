== Close Combat (CC) ==

Urban combat, attempting to take a building, or ship to ship space-boarding often occur in reduced spaces, which favors close combat with bladed weapons (knives, machetes, sabers, swords, claws, etc.) which we generically call Melee Weapons.


== Interacting with a Close Combat ==

Any Trooper in [[Silhouette]] contact with an Allied Model that is in the Engaged State may only declare [[CC Attack]], [[Dodge]] or other related Skills that may be used in CC. For example, in these circumstances declaring Skills such as [[Doctor]] or [[Engineer]] on a Trooper in Engaged State is not allowed.


{{greybox-start | Movement Sequence and CC}}
Close Combat is often associated with a Movement, the most common game sequence in this case is the following:


'''Step 1'''

The Active Player (Orange) consumes an Order and declares Move.

'''Step 2'''

The Reactive Player (Blue) declares CC Attack as their ARO.

'''Step 3'''

The Active Player (Orange) declares CC Attack as the second Short Skill of the Order.

'''Step 4'''

The corresponding Face to Face Roll is performed. Face to Face Roll:

Reactive Player: 1 Die in CC.

== CC Attack Modifiers (MOD) ==

Before performing the [[CC Attack]] Roll (or Rolls), the player must check every [[MOD]] they must apply. The [[MODs]] are:

*Close Combat against several enemies.
*Special Skills, Weapons and Equipment.


=== Close Combat With Multiple Troopers ===

==== During the Active Turn: ====

When declaring a CC Attack, the Player must select '''one''' [[Trooper]] or [[Peripheral]] activated by the Order. That Trooper or Peripheral performs the CC Attack and obtains a +1 [[MOD]] to [[B]] for each '''Allied [[Trooper]]''' or '''Peripheral''' that is not in a [[Null]] or [[Immobilized State]], and is in [[Silhouette]] contact with their target.


==== During the Reactive Turn: ====

{{update | PDF 2.1, July 2023}}
When declaring AROs, if the Reactive player decides to declare [[CC Attack]] they must select '''only one''' Trooper or Peripheral in {{erratahighlight}}Silhouette contact with the objective{{erratahighlight-end}}. The selected Trooper performs a CC Attack and will have a +1 [[MOD]] to [[B]] for each '''[[Allied]] [[Trooper]]''' or '''Peripheral''' in {{erratahighlight}}in Silhouette contact with the objective{{erratahighlight-end}}. The [[MOD]] is only applied for those allies that are not in a [[Null]] or [[Immobilized State]], and have not declared [[Dodge]], [[Idle]] or [[Reset]].

== Other Restrictions ==
When in Close Combat it is only possible to declare [[CC Attack]], [[Dodge]], [[Idle]] or [[Reset]]. 

The maximum number of Models that may be in [[Silhouette]] contact with a Model on a 25 mm base is 4.

The maximum number of Models that may be in [[Silhouette]] contact with a Model on a 40 mm or larger base is 6.


== Examples ==
{{greybox-start | Close Combat Against Several Enemies, Active Turn}}
In the image we have a Fusilier (Blue) and a Doctor Zhanshi YĪSHĒNG with his Servant Peripheral YÁOZĂO (Orange).


'''Step 1'''

The Active Player (Orange) consumes an Order and declares Move. 
{{image | name=eng-cc-several-enemies-active-1_v2.jpg | style=512border }}


'''Step 2'''

The Reactive Player (Blue) declares BS Attack against the Doctor as ARO. 
{{image | name=eng-cc-several-enemies-active-2.jpg | style=512border }}


'''Step 3'''

The Active Trooper declares CC Attack. The player chooses the Doctor to perform said CC Attack. The Doctor obtains a +1B MOD for having his Peripheral (Servant) in contact with his target. 
{{image | name=eng-cc-several-enemies-active-3_v2.jpg | style=512border }}


'''Step 4'''

Measurements for the BS Attack are made and the dice are rolled. Face to Face Roll:

Active Player: 2 Dice in CC. 

Reactive Player: 1 Die in BS.
{{image | name=eng-cc-several-enemies-active-4_v2.jpg | style=512border }}
{{greybox-end}}


{{greybox-start | Close Combat Against Several Enemies, Reactive Turn}}
In the Blue player’s Active Turn, a Move + CC Attack Order is added to the previous example’s melee:


'''Step 1'''

The Active Player (Blue) consumes an Order and declares Move until coming into Silhouette contact with the Peripheral (Servant).
{{image | name=eng-cc-several-enemies-reactive-1.jpg | style=512border }}


'''Step 2'''
Since the Troopers involved in a Close Combat do not have LoF outside Close Combat, they cannot declare BS Attack. Therefore, the Reactive Player (Orange) can only declare CC Attack, Reset, Idle or Dodge with their Peripheral (Servant).

They decide to declare CC Attack as ARO with their Peripheral (Servant).
{{image | name=eng-cc-several-enemies-reactive-2.jpg | style=512border }}


'''Step 3'''

As the second half of the Order, the Active Player declares CC Attack. 

The Fusilier obtains a +1B MOD thanks to his partner being in CC with the Peripheral (Servant). 

The Peripheral does not obtain the +1B MOD because its Controller is not in CC with the Active Trooper. 
{{image | name=eng-cc-several-enemies-reactive-3.jpg | style=512border }}


'''Step 4'''

The corresponding Rolls are performed. Face to Face Roll:

Active Player. 2 Dice in CC. 

Reactive Player: 1 Die in CC.
{{image | name=eng-cc-several-enemies-reactive-4.jpg | style=512border }}
{{greybox-end}}


== Special Skills and Equipment ==

Certain Special Skills, Weapons, and Equipment impose [[MODs]] to [[CC Attack]] Rolls, as seen in the rulebook (see [[Special Skills]], Weaponry, and [[Equipment]], although it is recommended that these concepts be applied as they appear in the game).
