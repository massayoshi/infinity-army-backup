When Troopers survive a successful Attack, it means their body armor took the brunt of the impact, keeping them from serious injury. This triggers a primal fear of death, and survival instincts kick in. The Troopers' survival instincts can force them to recoil from danger and dive for cover.

{{Effects}}
* A Guts Roll consists in a single Normal [[WIP]] Roll, always performed at the very end of the Order, after performing any [[Saving Rolls]].
* If the Guts Roll is successful, the Trooper must stand its ground and must do nothing else.
* If a Trooper would have to make a Guts Roll, its owner can instead choose to fail it automatically.
* '''If the WIP Roll is failed,''' it is compulsory to perform the first of these options that the Trooper can complete:
** 1. The Trooper must move up to 2 inches to '''completely leave''':
*** The LoF of the Enemy or Enemies (for example, in the case of a Coordinated Order, or multiple AROs) that have performed Attacks against the Trooper.  
*** The danger zone or Area of Effect of Attacks that did not require LoF. 
** 2. If this is not possible, the Trooper must move up to 2 inches to gain Total or Partial Cover from all attackers.
** 3. If the two previous options are not possible, the Trooper must go Prone, facing in any direction its player chooses.
* This movement of a failed Guts Roll:
** Does not generate AROs or activate Deployable Weapons or Equipment.
** Must follow the [[General Movement Rules]] as well as the [[Moving and Measuring]] rules.
** Does '''not''' allow the Trooper to enter Silhouette contact with enemy Troopers, or with Mission Objectives.


{{remember-start}}
Troopers in [[Engaged State]] do not make Guts Rolls.
