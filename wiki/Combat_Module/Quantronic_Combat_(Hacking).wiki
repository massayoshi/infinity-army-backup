In Infinity, infowar and cyberwarfare tasks, defined as Hacking, are shouldered by the [[Hacker]]s, specialized Troopers who can use the different Hacking Programs which define quantronic combat.

{{greybox-start | Getting Started with Hacking}}
According to their nature, [[Hacking Program]]s allow the Hacker to act in an aggressive or defensive manner, support other Troopers, interact with scenery, etc.

{{remember-start}}
When making your [[Army List]]s in [https://infinityuniverse.com/army/infinity Infinity Army], a summary of the [[Hacking Program]]s will be included, in the same way that a summary of your Troopersâ€™ weapons is included.

== Upgrade Programs (UPGRADE) ==
Custom-made software tailored to the style and preference of specific infowar operatives. If available, they will be listed in the [[Unit Profile]], in round brackets next to the name of the [[Hacker]] or the [[Hacking Device | Device]].


== Supportware Programs ==
These are programs of extended duration which are mainly designed to support [[allied]] Troopers on the battlefield by granting them bonuses to improve their combat capabilities. Likewise, they may also be designed to hinder [[enemy]] Troopers, applying negative MODs to them.

== Hacking Devices and Hacking Programs: Characteristics ==

[[Hacking Device]]s and [[Hacking Program]]s have the following characteristics:
*They act in the user's [[Hacking Area]].
*They do not require [[LoF]] to act, unless the Hacking Program's own description states otherwise. 
* Only Troopers in [[Model]] form may be targeted by Hacking Programs.
* They benefit, if applicable, from the target's [[Targeted]] State.


== Example of Quantronic Combat ==

'''Step 1:'''<br>
The Active Trooper declares a [[Move]] from point A to point B.

The Reactive Trooper declares a [[Carbonite]] Hacking Program [[ARO]].

The Active Trooper declares [[Reset]] for their second Skill of the Order. They do not declare a [[BS Attack]] against the Hacker because it is clear that they lack [[LoF]] to the Hacker along their entire movement path.

'''Step 2:'''<br>
The [[Face to Face Roll]]s are performed.

Active Trooper, Reset ([[WIP]] Roll, in this case there are no MODs to apply): 1 d20 with Success Value (SV) = 13.

Reactive Trooper, Carbonite (WIP Roll, in this case there are no MODs to apply): 1 d20 with SV = 13.

They both succeed, but the Reactive Trooper's 7 cancels the Active Trooper's 3.

'''Step 3:'''<br>
Therefore, as the Hacker wins the Face to Face Roll, the Active Trooper must perform 2 [[Saving Roll]]s due to [[DA]] Ammunition, against PS 7.
Saving Roll = 13 (PS 7 + BTS 6).

Due to the 14, the Active Trooper enters [[Immobilized-B State]], placing an Immobilized-B Token next to them.
