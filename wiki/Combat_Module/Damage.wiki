In Infinity, Damage is the capacity of a weapon, Attack, Special Skill, piece of Equipment, Hacking Program, etc. to harm or impair its target. The Damage value, represented by a number, is indicated on the weapon's profile or in the rules for the specific Special Skill, Equipment, etc.

However, this [[Damage]] is not usually applied to the target as is. Targets often have the right to a [[Saving Roll]] that determines if their Armor ([[ARM]]) or Biotechnological Shield ([[BTS]]) protects them from the [[Damage]]. 

Generally, each uncancelled success in an Attack Roll forces the target to perform one [[Saving Roll]]. 

The descriptive text of the type of Attack, Ammunition, Special Skill, Equipment, [[Hacking Program]], etc., used in an [[Attack]] indicates whether the target must use their [[ARM]], [[BTS]], or any other Attribute (or combination of them) when performing a [[Saving Roll]].
