Unless otherwise specified, each successful hit reduces the [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute of the target of the [[Attack]] by 1 point. When this happens, place a Wound Token (WOUND) next to the Trooper. Use the numbers on the Tokens to indicate the number of [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] points the Trooper has lost so far. If the Trooper has lost enough [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] points to fall [[Unconscious]], use an [[Unconscious]] State Token (UNCONSCIOUS) instead.

{{remember-start}}
Certain types of Ammunition, [[Attacks]], Equipment, Hacking Programs, etc. force the target to make more than one [[Saving Roll]] for each success in the Attack Roll (for example, [[DA]] ammunition forces the target to perform 2 [[Saving Rolls]] for each successful [[Attack]]). Others cause the target to lose more than 1 point of [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] when a [[Saving Roll]] is failed, or cause a change in the state of the target.

In these cases, the special effects are explained in the rule, or in the [[Weapon Chart]] itself.
