If the value of the [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute of a Trooper reaches 0, then that Trooper enters the [[Unconscious]] state.

However, if the [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute falls below 0, the Trooper enters the [[Dead]] state.

{{skillbox |red| UNCONSCIOUS | NULL}}
{{Activation}}
* A Trooper loses the last point of his [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute, leaving him with exactly zero.
{{Effects}}
*Troopers in this state cannot declare Orders or AROs.
*Unconscious Troopers automatically fall [[Prone]] unless they are a [[Troop Type]] unable to do so.
*Troopers in this state '''do not''' contribute Orders during the [[Tactical Phase]].
*Automatic Special Skills and Automatic Equipment have no effect while Unconscious.
*The Trooper does '''not''' count towards the Player's [[Victory Points]]. 
{{Cancellation}}
*To cancel this state, Troopers possessing the Wound Attribute need a Doctor, while Troopers with the Structure (STR) Attribute need an Engineer.
*A Trooper with the '''[[Doctor]]/[[Engineer]]''' Special Skill (or an equivalent Skill) may cancel the state by spending one Short Skill of an Order while in [[Silhouette]] contact with the affected Trooper, and passing a Normal '''[[WIP]]''' Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario).
*Other Special Skills and pieces of Equipment allow the cancellation of the Unconscious state as indicated in their rules. 
*Cancelling the Unconscious state automatically '''cancels the [[Prone]] state.'''
