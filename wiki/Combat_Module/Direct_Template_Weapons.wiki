As their name implies, these are the ones where the Template is placed directly touching the edge of the attacking Trooper's [[Silhouette]], or centred on the attacker for the Circular Template.

{{skillbox |bluegrey| DIRECT TEMPLATE WEAPONS |}}
{{Effects}}
* They do not require a BS Roll to hit.
{{c1}}
* The Template must be placed '''when declaring the [[Attack]]''' in order to determine which Troopers will be affected by the [[Attack]], as this may influence their possible ARO, or second Short Skill of their Order. {{seefaq}}
{{c1end}}
{{n4list}}
* The Template must be placed '''when declaring the [[Attack]]''' in order to determine if the Main Target is inside in the Area of Effect and which Troopers and Game Elements (Markers, Deployable weapons or  Equipment…) will be affected by the [[Attack]], as this may influence their possible ARO, or second Short Skill of their Order. {{seefaq}}
{{n4end}}
** '''Direct Teardrop Template''' (Chain Rifle, Flamethrower, etc.): The narrow end of the Teardrop Template (Blast Focus) must be placed in contact with the edge of the Silhouette of the Trooper declaring the [[Attack]]. Every Trooper affected by the Template will suffer the [[Attack]]. The Template cannot be placed so that it would go through the [[Silhouette]] of the Trooper that is declaring the [[Attack]] (see example).
** '''Direct Circular Template:''' The center of the Circular Template (''Blast Focus'') must be placed over the center of the base of the Trooper declaring the Attack, and every Trooper affected by the Template will suffer the Attack.
* Dodging a Direct Template Weapon requires a '''Normal [[PH]] Roll''' (or [[PH]]-3 as mentioned previously).
* If a Trooper affected by a Direct Template Weapon declares an Attack against the user of the Direct Template Weapon, their [[Attack]] will be a Normal Roll (if the Weapon, Special Skill, etc, requires a Roll). In the Resolution step of the Order, the Trooper will need to make a [[Saving Roll]], since this type of Template Weapon affects targets directly, without needing to Roll to hit. 
* Those Direct Template Weapons that have a '''Burst (B) value higher than 1''', allow the Template to be placed as many times per Order as their [[Burst]] (B) value indicates, and to distribute this [[B]] among different targets if so wished. 
{{update | 1.3, Nov 2022}}
* {{erratahighlight}}In ARO, any Active Trooper in the Area of Effect of the Template during the Order counts as a Main Target when checking whether the Template is cancelled.{{erratahighlight-end}}

{{important-start}}
To [[Dodge]] an Attack with '''several Direct Templates''' in the same Order, a single Normal [[PH]] (or [[PH]]-3) Roll must be passed, allowing the Trooper to [[Dodge]] all Templates with one Roll.
{{important-end}}


{{important-start}}
Despite being in contact with the Template, Troopers declaring an [[Attack]] with a Direct Template will not be affected by it, unless otherwise specified in the Weapon's, Skill's or Type of Ammunition's description.

=== Direct Template Placement Examples ===
{{greybox-start | Direct Template Weapon Placement }}
{{image | name=eng-dtw-example-1.jpg | style=512border }}
Direct Template Weapon, Blast Focus and placement of the Template.

{{image | name=eng-dtw-example-2.jpg | style=512border }}
The Template’s placement cannot pass through the Trooper’s own Silhouette.

{{n4}}
{{image | name=eng-circular-template-placement-1024.jpg | style=512border }}
The center of the Circular Template (Blast Focus) must match the center of the underside of the Trooper’s base. 
{{n4end}}
{{greybox-end}}


{{greybox-start | Direct Template With Burst (B2): Area of Effect, Placement, and Troopers at Different Levels}}
{{image | name=eng-dtw-burst2.jpg | style=512border }}

During his Active Turn, a Betatrooper with Nanopulser (B+1), Direct Template BS Weapon, declares Move and BS Attack with B2 from the point he has chosen to perform the BS Attack, the Betatrooper may place each Template freely, affecting different targets if he so chooses.

The Betatrooper affects 3 out of 4 enemies in range. Being Direct Templates, Attacks declared as ARO will not be Face to Face Rolls.

Being in Prone state, Trooper nº3 will remain unaffected by the Template, since it does not touch their base.
{{greybox-end}}


=== Direct Templates and Cover Examples ===

{{greybox-start |Area of Effect, Blast Focus, and Scenery}}
{{image | name=eng-dtw-example-3.jpg | style=512border }}

The Scenery element completely covers the enemy Trooper. Therefore, LoF cannot be traced from the Blast Focus so the Trooper is not affected by the Area of Effect.
{{greybox-end}}


{{greybox-start | Area of Effect, Placement and Total Cover}}
{{image | name=eng-dtw-example-4.jpg | style=512border }}

The enemy Trooper is unaffected by the Template given that, being Prone, their Silhouette is X, and therefore has their base’s height. If the Trooper was not Prone they would be affected by the Template.
{{greybox-end}}


{{n4}}
=== Direct Templates, Shot Cancelled ===

{{greybox-start | Example of a Direct Teardrop Template Weapon. Shot Cancelled }}
{{image | name=eng-direct-template-cancelled-1024.jpg | style=512border }}

In this picture, we have a Betatrooper who declares a BS Attack against a Fusilier with his Direct Template Weapon (a Nanopulser). He places it in such a way that it affects an enemy Camouflage Marker (CAMO). Since the Fusilier is not in the Area of Effect of the Teardrop Template, the Attack is cancelled and the Marker remains unaffected.
