These weapons place a Template at the point of impact.

{{css_skillbox |black| IMPACT TEMPLATE WEAPONS |}}
{{Requirements}}
* Impact Template Weapons require an '''Attack Roll, using [[BS]], [[PH]],''' or the appropriate [[Attribute]] to hit.
* It is obligatory to declare a valid Main Target who will be the reference to place the Circular Template. The Main Target must be in [[LoF]] when declaring the Attack.
* When the Attack is declared, the center of the Circular Template (Blast Focus) must be placed over the center of the Main Target's base. This way, the player will check the [[Area of Effect]] and determine which Troopers or game elements (Markers, weapons, Deployables...) are affected by this Attack.

{{effects}}
* The Circular Template only applies its effect on each affected Trooper if the [[Normal Roll|Normal]] or [[Face to Face Roll]] is successful.
* The Trooper who declared the Attack compares this Roll against each enemy trooper affected by the Template individually. Each enemy Trooper affected by the template resolves their Face to Face Roll completely independently of each other. The Face to Face Roll of one affected enemy Trooper '''cannot''' affect the Face to Face Rolls of the others (see the example below).
* All MODs applied to the attacker's Roll are determined using a valid '''Main Target '''as the basis. As stated above, this Roll is compared separately against the Rolls of each of the other enemy Troopers affected by the Template ("Secondary Targets" from now on).
* In order to [[Dodge]] an Attack with an Impact Template Weapon, the Main Target and any Secondary Targets affected by the Impact Template may make a Face to Face Roll with their [[PH]] (or PH-3 in the cases mentioned under Effects) against the attacker's Attack Roll.
* Impact Template, '''Special Cases''':
** When using an Impact Template Weapon with the [[Targetless]] Trait (such those using [[Smoke Ammunition]]), you do not need to declare an enemy Trooper as the Main Target; the target can be an area on the game table.
** When declaring '''[[Speculative Attack]]''' with an Impact Template Weapon, you do not have to place the Circular Template over the center of the target's base.

{{important-start}}
To [[Dodge]] an Attack with several Impact Templates in the same Order, every [[Face to Face Roll]] must be performed separately against the [[PH]] Roll (or PH-3 Roll, according to the case) of the target Trooper, allowing the Trooper to dodge all Templates with a single Roll.

{{greybox-start | Example of Impact Template Weapon. Targets React with BS Attack and Dodge Without LoF. Shot Cancelled. }}
{{image | name=n5/eng-impact-template-example-1.jpg | style= fullborder }}
The Unidron declares [[BS Attack]] with his Plasma Carbine in Blast Mode, targeting Fennecs 1 and 2, hoping that the template would also affect Fennec 3.

After declaring the BS Attack, the Circular Templates are centered on the Fennecs and it is indeed checked that they also affect Fennec 3, as well as the [[Unconscious]] Unidron next to Fennec 1.

Therefore, Fennec 3 gains the right to [[ARO]], since he was affected by a Template Weapon and the other Attack, declared against Fennec 1, was cancelled because it affected an [[Allied]] Trooper.

In that moment, Fennecs 1 and 2 declare their AROs: BS Attack. Fennec 3 declares [[Dodge]] (PH-3 due to the lack of [[LoF]] to his attacker).

Thus, the following Rolls are performed:

One [[Normal Roll]] from Fennec 1 against the Unidron.

Two Face to Face Rolls from the Unidron against Fennecs 2 and 3. The result obtained by the Unidron after applying all relevant MODs will be compared separately with the BS Attack of Fennec 2 and the Dodge of Fennec 3.

By performing an Attack with an Impact Template, the Circular Template is centered on the underside of the Main Targetâ€™s Base, regardless of the impact point on the target. Any Game Element in contact or within the [[Area of Effect]] of the Circular Template will also be affected by the Attack. As we see in the picture, thanks to the scenery element, it is not possible to draw a [[LoF]] from the Blast Focus to Trooper 3, who is therefore unaffected.
