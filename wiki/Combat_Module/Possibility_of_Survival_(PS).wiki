In Infinity, the Possibility of Survival (PS) is the capacity of a weapon, Attack, Special Skill, piece of Equipment, Hacking Program, etc. to harm or impair its target. The PS value, represented by a number, is indicated on the weaponâ€™s profile or in the rules for the specific Special Skill, Equipment, etc.

However, this PS value is not usually applied to the target as is. Targets often have the right to a [[Saving Roll]] that determines if their Armor ([[ARM]]) or Biotechnological Shield ([[BTS]]) protects them from this damage.

Generally, each uncancelled success in an Attack Roll forces the target to perform one Saving Roll.

The descriptive text of the type of Attack, Ammunition, Special Skill, Equipment, Hacking Program, etc., used in an Attack indicates whether the target must use their ARM, BTS, or any other Attribute (or combination of them) when performing a Saving Roll.

The PS value indicates the lethality of a weapon, based on the probability of the target surviving the hit. The lower the PS value, the more lethal the weapon.
