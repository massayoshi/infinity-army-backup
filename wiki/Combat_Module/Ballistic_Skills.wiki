Ranged combat and firefights are the foundation of modern warfare and play an equally pivotal role in Infinity. 


== BS Attack Into a Close Combat ==
If a [[BS Attack]] is declared against an enemy Trooper that is engaged in [[Close Combat | CC Combat]] a -6 MOD must be applied for each [[Allied]] Trooper engaged in the CC (in addition to any MODs for [[Range]], [[Cover]], [[Mimetism]]... for the target). 

Every failed BS Attack Roll will hit the Allied Trooper, forcing them to perform a [[Saving Roll]]. If there are several Allied Troopers locked in that Close Combat, then the Trooper’s player chooses which one of them receives each hit.


== BS Attack Modifiers (MOD) ==

Before performing the [[BS Attack]] Roll (or Rolls), the player must check every [[MOD]] they must apply. There are MODs that will affect the numerical value of the roll, the Attribute and others may affect the BS Attack Roll's [[Burst]] (B). Existing MODs are:

*Cover
*Range
*[[Special Skill]]s, [[Weaponry | Weapons]], pieces of [[Equipment]], or [[States]].

=== Cover ===

The term Cover refers to all pieces of scenery that partially or completely obstruct [[LoF]], thus preventing the attacker from making a clean [[BS Attack]].

{{effects}}
* If the target is in '''Total Cover''', the attacker may not perform a BS Attack with Weapons, Special Skills, or Equipment, that requires [[LoF]].
* If the target is in '''Partial Cover''', the attacker will apply a -3 MOD to their BS Attack Roll, and the target of the BS Attack applies a +3 MOD to its [[Saving Roll (SR)]], if necessary.


=== Types of Cover ===

==== Total Cover ====
Total Cover completely blocks the attacker’s vision of his target, obstructing any [[LoF]] to their [[Silhouette]].

The target is in Total Cover when one or more scenery items completely blocks LoF to its Silhouette.

==== Partial Cover ====
Partial Cover does not allow the attacker to see the whole [[Silhouette]] of their [[BS Attack]]’s target.

The target is in Partial Cover when they are in contact with a piece of scenery that partially obscures their Silhouette.

'''PARTIAL COVER'''

Partial Cover due to being in contact with a scenery element that covers part of the target’s [[Silhouette]].

=== Range ===

All [[BS Weapon]]s, pieces of [[Equipment]], and [[Special Skill]]s that can make [[BS Attack]]s apply a Range MOD that depends on the distance between the attacker and the target.

If the target is beyond the maximum Range of the BS Weapon, piece of Equipment or Special Skill, then the BS Attack automatically fails (the Order is spent, [[Disposable]] weapons lose a use, etc.).

For example, for the Combi Rifle we have the following values:

{{image | name=n5/combi-rifle-1024.jpg | style=fullborder }}

{{n5_weapon_single}}
{{n5_weaponrow|Combi Rifle|+3|+3|-3|-3|-6|-6|--|7|3|N|ARM|1|[[Suppressive Fire Trait | Suppressive Fire]]}}
|}

* If the distance between the Trooper and the Target is from 0 to 16 inches, the Trooper has a +3 MOD to their BS Attack Roll due to Range.
* If the distance is greater than 16 inches and equal to or less than 32 inches, the Trooper has a -3 MOD to their BS Attack Roll due to Range.
* If the distance is greater than 32 inches and equal to or less than 48 inches, the Trooper has a -6 MOD to their BS Attack Roll due to Range.
* The BS Attack automatically fails if the Range is more than 48 inches.


=== Special Skills, Weapons, Equipment, or States ===

Certain [[Special Skill]]s, [[Weapons]], [[Equipment]] or [[States]] can apply a MOD to [[BS Attack]] Rolls. These Special Skills, Weapons, pieces of Equipment, or States are explained in the respective sections of this rulebook.
