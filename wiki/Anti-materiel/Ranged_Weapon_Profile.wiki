In Infinity, every Weapon has its own game profile and some of them even have special usage rules. This chapter describes how to read such a profile, and each Weapon is detailed individually in the [[Weapons Chart]]. The MULTI Rifle will be used as an example to explain how to read a BS Weapon profile.

== MULTI Rifle ==
{{greybox-start|Example 1}}

{{n5_weapon_single}}
{{n5_weaponrow|MULTI Rifle (Anti-materiel Mode)|+3|+3|-3|-3|-6|-6|--|7|1|DA|ARM|2|[[Anti-materiel]]}}
{{n5_weaponrow|MULTI Rifle (AP Mode)|+3|+3|-3|-3|-6|-6|--|7|3|AP|ARM/2|1|[[Suppressive Fire]]}}

MULTI Weapons are an example of Weapons that have more than one firing mode. Each firing mode has a '''[[Burst]] (B)''' and different '''[[Ammunition]]''' associated with them. The player must decide which firing mode to use each time they declare a [[BS Attack]].

The MULTI Rifle in AP Mode can use [[AP Ammunition]] and B3. This means that if the player declares BS Attack, they will roll 3 dice with AP Ammunition. Conversely, if they decide to use Anti-materiel Mode they will have just 1 die available, but will use [[DA Ammunition]].

== Profile Key ==

'''[[Range]]''' indicates the Weapon's reach in inches. In this case the MULTI Rifle has a reach of 0 to 48 inches, this reach is divided in different ranges that imply different MODs to the BS Attack Roll, as explained in the [[Range]] Modifier section.

'''[[Possibility of Survival (PS)]]''' indicates the destructive capability of the Weapon. The lower the PS value, the more powerful the Weapon.

'''[[Burst]]''' (B) is the number of dice the Active Player must roll when declaring a [[BS Attack]]. '''Remember that in the Reactive Turn the value of B is 1''', unless modified by a rule or Skill.

The '''[[Ammunition]]''' column indicates what Type of Ammunition the Weapon uses. If two Types of Ammunition are shown linked by a "+" it means both Types are combined.

The '''[[Saving Roll]] Attribute''' column indicates which Attribute or Attributes ([[ARM]], [[BTS]], [[PH]], ARM+BTS, etc.) any Saving Rolls are made against to avoid the hit's damage or Effects. As with Ammunition, saving against different Attributes or their combination may be necessary (see [[Possibility of Survival (PS)]]). The Attribute can also be shown with MODs, usually negative (-3, -6), or it can directly show the value for that Attribute (ARM=0).

The '''Number of Saving Rolls''' (SR: No) column indicates the number of [[Saving Roll]]s that need to be made for every hit received.

'''[[Traits]]''' are special features some Weapons and pieces of Equipment possess. They are all explained in the Labels and [[Traits]] Section. An asterisk (*) in this section indicates that the Weapon or piece of Equipment has extra rules in the corresponding section of the rulebook.


{{greybox-start|Example 2}}
A weapon that uses [[AP]]+[[DA]] Ammunition indicates that the target must perform 2 [[Saving Roll]]s for each hit received (due to DA Ammunition), with the corresponding Saving Roll Attribute halved (due to AP Ammunition).

Next, two more examples on how to read the [[Weapons Chart]] are shown.


== Breaker Combi Rifle ==
{{greybox-start|Example 3}}
{{image | name=n5/breaker-rifle.jpg | style=fullborder }}
{{n5_weapon_single}}
{{n5_weaponrow|Breaker Combi Rifle|+3|+3|-3|-3|-6|-6|--|7|3|AP|BTS/2|1|[[Suppressive Fire]]}}
|}

The Breaker Combi Rifle indicates that for each received impact the target must perform one [[Saving Roll]], with their [[BTS]] Attribute halved.
{{greybox-end}}


== MediKit ==
{{greybox-start|Example 4}}
{{n5_weapon_single}}
{{n5_weaponrow|[[MediKit]]|+3|0|-6|--|--|--|--|--|1|--|--|--|[[Non-Lethal]], [***]}}
|}

The [[MediKit]] is a piece of Equipment that is a Non-Lethal BS Weapon. Therefore, the Weapons Chart indicates the Range MOD. Although in the [[Traits]] section the [***] indicates that it is a weapon or piece of Equipment that has additional explanation in the [[Skills and Equipment Module | Skills and Equipment]] section of the rulebook.
