{{section-movement-module}}


You can measure Movement distances immediately after declaring any Skill with the [[Movement Label | Movement]] Label and before determining where the Trooper ends his Movement, always measuring from the same point on the base’s outer edge and underside.

The sequence of events is: 
# The player declares a Skill with the [[Movement Label | Movement]] Label. 
# Measure to find out which locations the Trooper could reach with that Skill. 
# Declare the final location, and the exact route that the Trooper is taking to reach it. 
# Move the Trooper to the final location.
