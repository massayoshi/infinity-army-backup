* When moving Troopers around the battlefield, players must measure the complete route (including, for example, any detour to avoid obstacles) and must '''always use the same part of the base''' for their measurements.
* [[MOV]] values indicate the maximum distance the unit can move, but there is no minimum. Troopers do not have to exhaust their movement when they declare [[Move]].
* A Trooper can move over any scenery item whose height is equal to or lower than the height of the Trooper’s [[Silhouette Template]], with no need to declare [[Climb]] or [[Jump]]. <br> This vertical movement is not taken into account when measuring how far the Trooper moves, but the Trooper counts as moving up and over the obstacle for the purposes of [[LoF]].
* A Trooper can move through allied Models, Markers, and Tokens, whose [[Silhouette Template]] height is equal to or lower than the height of the Trooper’s [[Silhouette Template]]. The Trooper cannot end their movement within the allied Model, Marker, or Token.
* Troopers have a [[LoF]] arc of 360º while they are moving.
* After Moving one of your models, you can leave it facing any direction.
* A Trooper's Movement ends automatically whenever he enters [[Silhouette]] contact with an enemy, even if the specified movement route is cut short as a result.
{{c1}}
* By performing any Skill or ARO with the [[Movement Label]], a Trooper may enter or leave '''[[Prone]]''' State '''at the start of his Movement''' at no cost. Remember that Troopers have reduced mobility while Prone.

* By performing any Skill or ARO with the [[Movement Label]], or moving as the result of a failed [[Guts Roll]], a Trooper may enter or leave '''[[Prone]]''' State '''at the start of his Movement''' at no cost. Remember that Troopers have reduced mobility while Prone. 
{{n4end}}
* Independently of the type of movement performed ([[Move]], [[Jump]], [[Climb]], etc.), the movement cannot, in any way, cause the [[Trooper]] to fall. If the Trooper cannot reach a new location with their [[Move]], [[Jump]], [[Climb]]…  they do not perform the movement and perform an [[Idle]] instead.
* Once declared, Troopers always reach the end of their Movement, even if they enter a [[Null]] or [[Immobilized]] state due to successful enemy Attacks along the way.
{{n4list}}
* Mounting and dismounting: By performing any Skill with the Movement Label, a Trooper may mount or dismount a Motorcycle, TAG, Vehicle, etc. {{seefaq | There are exceptions for Possessed State. }}
** The Trooper must mount or dismount at the start of the Order, after having declared the first Short Skill of the Order, or the Entire Order, but before measuring any movement.
** The new Troop Profile (Mounted/Dismounted) is applied for the entire Order Sequence, while the original profile will not be considered.
** The Skill with the Movement Label must be one that can be declared by the original profile. For example if the Trooper is in [[Engaged]] State or an IMM State at the start of the Order, they cannot declare a Movement Skill to mount or dismount, and a TAG, Vehicle, or a Trooper mounted on a Motorcycle cannot declare [[Cautious Movement]], which allows other Troopers to mount or dismount.
** Mounting or dismounting will cancel the [[Hidden Deployment]] State, and any Marker State, of both profiles.

== Move: Ladders and Stairs ==
{{greybox-start | Move: Ladders and Stairs}}
{{image | name=eng-ladders.jpg | style=512border }}

{{image | name=eng-stairs.jpg | style=512border }}

Those pieces of scenery representing stairs and ladders allow Troopers to treat those vertical or diagonal surfaces as a horizontal surface. Therefore, the Trooper can use any Skill or [[ARO]] with the [[Movement Label]] without needing to declare [[Jump]] or [[Climb]], and without applying restrictions for [[Jump]] or [[Climb]]. Movement distances are measured along the surface the Trooper moves along, as seen in the diagram.

== Move and Obstacles ==
{{greybox-start | Move and Obstacles}}
Example of Movement over an obstacle lower than the height of the [[Silhouette]]. 

{{image | name=eng-vault-pass.jpg | style=512border }}

The Trooper may bypass the obstacle without declaring [[Jump]] or [[Climb]], since the obstacle’s height is equal to or lower than the height of the Trooper’s [[Silhouette]] Template, on both sides.

{{image | name=eng-vault-fail.jpg | style=512border }}

Conversely, in the second picture, the Trooper may not pass over the obstacle without declaring [[Jump]] or [[Climb]], since the obstacle is higher than the height of the Trooper’s [[Silhouette]] Template on one side.

{{remember-start}}
Once declared, Troopers always reach the end of their Movement, even if they enter a [[Null]] or [[Immobilized]] state due to successful enemy [[Attack]]s along the way.

== Example ==
{{greybox-start | Example of Movement }}
{{image | name=eng-move-example-1-1024.jpg | style=512border }}

In his Active Turn, the Fusilier is leaning against a wall in Total Cover. He does not have LoF to the Zhanshi, on the other side of the building. The Fusilier declares his first Short Skill: Move.

Therefore, the Player will measure the trajectory’s distance, determine his direction and path, then move the Fusilier’s base so that his base peeks around the corner to gain LoF to his target while still in Partial Cover.

{{image | name=eng-move-example-2-1024.jpg | style=512border }}

Once he has seen the Zhanshi, the Fusiliers’ model returns to his original position in Total Cover. His Move declaration will take him to the corner and back.

{{image | name=eng-move-example-3-1024.jpg | style=512border }}

Since the Zhanshi also gains LoF to the Fusilier, he declares his ARO: BS Attack.

The Fusilier then declares the second Short Skill of his Order, another BS Attack.

In the subsequent Face to Face Roll, the Zhanshi suffers the Partial Cover MODs, however he wins the Face to Face Roll, while the Fusilier fails his Saving Roll. Then, the Fusilier would end his Order in Unconscious state behind Total Cover, where he finished his movement.

== Examples from Move ==
{{greybox-start | Move over catwalks and narrow corridors }}

{{image | name=eng-move-narrow-3-1024.jpg | style=512border }}
{{greybox-end}}


{{greybox-start | Order (Move + Move) on surfaces that are smaller than the base}}
{{image | name=eng-move-smaller-than-base.jpg | style=512border }}

Although in both cases the Distance covered is 8 inches, in case B, it is not possible to carry out the movement because there is no valid surface at the end of the first Movement value.
