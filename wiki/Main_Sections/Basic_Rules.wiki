These basic rules are one of the pillars of the general game mechanics; these are the rules all players must know in order to play. This chapter creates the game engine that establishes Infinity as an excellent modern tactical combat simulator.

Basic rules establish the characteristics of Infinity Troopers and the way in which they behave inside the game environment. They also determine how to create combat forces and the rules needed to begin playing, as well as the game structure. The fundamental section of this chapter is the explanation of the Orders system, the central core of the game model that players will be using constantly. It is the system that enables players to participate during the entire game, without having to stop playing at any point.


{{Greybox-start | WHAT YOU NEED}}
To play Infinity you will need the following things:
* A measuring tape of at least 48 inches.
* Some 20-sided dice (d20).
* Corvus Belli miniatures to represent the Troopers of both players.
* Scenery. At least 4 big elements and 10 small items. As it will be soon become apparent, scenery and terrain are a very important part of Infinity.
* A 48 x 48-inch gaming table. Although the game can be played on smaller surfaces, this is the ideal gaming table size to player larger games of Infinity.
* Markers, Tokens and templates. All of them available for free on the Download section of the official Infinity website at [https://www.infinitytheuniverse.com www.infinitytheuniverse.com].

== Game Elements: Terminology and Alignment ==

This rules set uses precise terminology throughout to refer to key elements of the game that players have at their disposal.

You can find all Infinity [[Terminology]] and [[Alignment]] in the [[Glossary]].

{{advice-start}}
I'll give you the definitions of Troopers and Peripherals, because they are the main terms that you will find mentioned in the rules.

'''Trooper.''' Game element with Attributes which belongs to the Army List of any player, '''able to contribute and spend Orders''', as well as declaring and receiving Attacks.

{{image | name=eng-peripheral-256.png | style= 2eminline }} '''Peripheral. Special''' category of Trooper that is '''unable to contribute or spend Orders by itself''' and, therefore, takes no space in the Army List. It is activated when its Controller, the Trooper on which it depends, spends an Order, replicating their actions.

== Labels and Traits in Infinity ==
The function of Labels and Traits is to quickly indicate details and to group common features.

=== [[Labels]] ===
[[Labels]] indicate a series of defining aspects of a Skill, Special Skill or piece of Equipment for quick reference. You can find all Infinity Labels in the [[Glossary]].

=== [[Traits]] ===
Most weapons and Equipment have special features, called [[Traits]]. 

Traits usually relate to Common Skills or Special Skills, or to specific effects that make these items special. Some of them are self-explanatory. You can find all Infinity Traits in the [[Glossary]].


== Armies ==
In Infinity there are several Factions that represent the different Armies of the Human Sphere and the alien forces of the Combined Army.

== Game States ==

‘State’ is a game term for each of the altered conditions, beneficial or not, that a Trooper or game element might find itself in.

Each State has a specific game effect, as well as individual methods of activation and cancellation. States in Infinity are cumulative, and are indicated by placing State Tokens next to an affected Trooper.
