The basic rules are one of the pillars of the general game mechanics; these are the rules all players must know in order to play. This chapter creates the game engine that establishes Infinity as an excellent modern tactical combat simulator.

Basic Rules establish the characteristics of Infinity Troopers and the way in which they behave inside the game environment. They also determine how to create combat forces and the rules needed to begin playing, as well as the game structure. The fundamental section of this chapter is the explanation of the Orders system, the central core of the game model that players will be using constantly. It is the system that enables players to participate during the entire game, without having to stop playing at any point.
