The tactical flexibility inherent in Infinity allows games to be more interesting than a typical exterminate-the-enemy scenario. The purpose of a scenario is to accomplish a mission by meeting its defined objectives and obtaining the Objective Points designated for each met objective.

While playing a scenario, the player who gets the higher number of Objective Points is the winner.

In the event of a tie regarding the number of Objective Points scored, both players will have to compare their [[Victory Points]]. The player with the highest value of Victory Points will win the tiebreak.

This section includes a small set of missions that serve as an introduction to this new level of gaming. Find more free content in the downloads section of the infinity official website: [http://www.infinitytheuniverse.com www.infinitytheuniverse.com].
