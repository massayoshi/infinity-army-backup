== [[Skills and Equipment in Infinity]] ==

Infinity CodeOne possesses a series of Skills and pieces of Equipment which allows a Trooper to act during the game. Moreover, in this section we will explain how [[Unit Profiles]] are notated, for a simpler and quicker understanding of the information about Skills and pieces of Equipment. [[Skills and Equipment in Infinity|[continued...]]]


== [[Common Skills]] in Infinity ==
Common Skills can be employed by any Trooper, without needing to be listed in the [[Unit Profile]]. [[Common Skills|[continued...]]]


== [[Special Skills]] in Infinity ==
This type of Skills cannot be performed by every Trooper, only by those with it listed in their [[Unit Profile]]. Troopers belonging to that Unit have received special training or have pieces of Equipment or natural skills that allows them to perform the Special Skill. [[Special Skills|[continued...]]]


== Infinity [[Equipment]] ==
All the special Effects provided by pieces of Equipment are detailed next. [[Equipment|[continued...]]]

{{Important_Start}}
Each Level a piece of Equipment can have is separate, and not cumulative with other levels. Therefore, only MODs and special rules indicated by the Level of the Trooperâ€™s Equipment may be used.
