This rulebook uses a series of terms that describe and refer to certain concepts that are important for understanding the game mechanics and the way specific rules, skills, weapons, and pieces of Equipment work.

This section compiles all these terms for quick reference. However, it is recommended that the players are introduced to these concepts gradually as they come up during their first games.
