The Infinity Fireteams rule allows players to activate a team of Troopers who support another Trooper—called Fireteam Leader—with reduced Order expenditure. 

{{advice-start}}
This rule allows the activation of groups composed of 2 to 5 Troopers by spending a single Regular Order during the Active Turn, which will grant a set of Bonuses in both the Active and Reactive Turn.

These Troopers must be in Coherency by remaining inside the Zone of Control of the Fireteam Leader, the Trooper who bears the weight of the Order during the Active Turn. Fireteam Leadership can alternate between the Fireteam members; players can change the Leader with each new Order.
