The Infinity Fireteams rule enables a team of Troopers to move and act as one in support of its '''Fireteam Leader''', using fewer Orders than usual.


{{advice-start}}
This rule allows the activation of groups composed of 2 to 5 Troopers by spending a single [[Regular Order]] during the [[Active Turn]], which will grant a set of [[Fireteam Bonuses | Bonuses]] in both the Active and [[Reactive Turn]].

These Troopers must be in [[Coherency]] by remaining inside the [[Zone of Control]] of the Fireteam Leader, the Trooper who bears the weight of the Order during the Active Turn. Fireteam Leadership can alternate between the Fireteam members; players can change the Leader with each new [[Trooper Activation | Order]].
