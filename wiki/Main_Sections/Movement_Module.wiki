In Infinity, movement allows troopers to get around the game board. This section details all necessary rules to perform such movements.

Movement takes place within the normal [[Order Expenditure Sequence]].

The Movement Attribute (MOV) from the [[Unit Profile]] indicates the number of inches this Trooper can move with an Order. The MOV Attribute usually has two values: the first time the Trooper moves in an Order, and the second.
