In Infinity, movement allows troopers to get around the game board. This section details all necessary rules to perform such movements.

Movement takes place within the normal [[Order Expenditure Sequence]].

The [[Unit_Profile#Movement_.28MOV.29 | Movement Attribute (MOV)]] from the [[Unit Profile]] indicates the number of inches this Trooper can move with an [[Order]]. The MOV Attribute usually has two values: the first time the Trooper moves in an Order, and the second.
