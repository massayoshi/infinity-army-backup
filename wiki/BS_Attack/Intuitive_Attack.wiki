Intuitive Attack represents those times when a soldier perceives movement through the corner of his eye and instinctively sprays the area with his weapon in the hopes of unearthing a hidden enemy.

{{css_skillbox |red| INTUITIVE ATTACK | LONG SKILL }}
{{skill-label | BS Attack }}
{{requirements}}
* The user must employ a [[BS Weapon]] with the [[Intuitive Attack Trait]].
* The target of the Intuitive Attack (or Main Target if using a [[Template Weapon]]) must be outside the user's [[LoF]] due to a [[Zero Visibility Zone]], or be in a State that would normally prevent Attacks from being performed against them without previously being [[Discover]]ed, such as the [[Camouflaged State]].

{{effects}}
* The user may perform a single '''[[BS Attack]] Roll''' against the target. <br>The '''[[Burst]] (B) of this BS Attack will always be 1''' regardless of the actual B value of the Weapon or any MODs applied to the B.
* In order to make an Intuitive Attack, the user must pass an unmodified [[WIP]] Roll. MODs from [[Partial Cover]], Special Skills, pieces of Equipment or any other source do not apply to this Roll.
* If the target reacts by declaring an Attack or [[Dodge]], his reaction is simultaneous and resolved by a [[Face to Face Roll]], if applicable.
* If the user fails his WIP Roll, he cannot attempt to make another Intuitive Attack against the same target until his next Active Turn.
* If more than one enemy would be affected by the Intuitive Attack, the shooter must choose only one of them as the Main Target.
* If the WIP Roll is a [[Critical]], it counts as a Critical against the Main Target of the attack, and only the Main Target. Against other targets affected by the Intuitive Attack, it is a successful Roll instead of a Critical.
* An Intuitive Attack must be declared in order to '''place a [[Deployable Weapon]]''' on the gaming table if there is an enemy [[Camouflaged]] Marker (CAMO) inside its [[Trigger Area]]. This restriction does not apply if there is a valid, non-camouflaged enemy Model inside the Trigger Area. If the WIP Roll is failed, the Deployable Weapon is not placed on the table and, if it also has the [[Disposable]] Trait, one use must be considered spent.

{{greybox-start | Example of Intuitive Attack }}
{{image | name=n5/dual-direct-template-example-5.jpg | style=fullborder }}
Trooper A declares an Intuitive Attack against the [[Camouflaged]] Marker [CAMO].

The Marker [CAMO] has two options:
* Declare nothing and not reveal itself unless Trooper A passes the required [[WIP]] Roll, in which case it will be hit by the template and be forced to make the corresponding [[Saving Roll]], which would reveal it.
* Declare [[Dodge]], [[BS Attack]], etc. and oppose Trooper A’s WIP Roll with its ARO.
In this situation, if Trooper B was affected by the Template, his Roll would oppose Trooper A’s WIP Roll.
