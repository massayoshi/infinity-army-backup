=== [[:Category:Airborne Deployment (AD) | Airborne Deployment (AD) ]] ===
This label encompasses all the Skills that are related to Airborne Infantry. Any rule mentioning Airborne Deployment will affect all the Skills that have this Label.

=== [[:Category:Assignable (Transmutation) | Assignable (Transmutation) ]] ===
When deploying its owner during the [[Deployment Phase]], and only then, this weapon or piece of Equipment can be assigned to Troopers who possess the [[Transmutation (X)]] Special Skill, and are present on the game table as a Model (excluding Troopers using [[Airborne Deployment]], [[Hidden Deployment]], [[Impersonation State]], etc.).

A Trooper possessing the Transmutation (X) Special Skill cannot receive more than one weapon or piece of Equipment of the same type with the Assignable (Transmutation) Label.

Weapons and pieces of Equipment with the Assignable Label must be placed and remain in base contact with their user, the assigned Trooper, moving along with them.

These weapons and pieces of Equipment are Game [[State Token]]s rather than Model.

=== [[:Category:Attack | Attack ]] ===
The use of this Special Skill or piece of Equipment is considered an Attack. Remember that you cannot declare attacks against [[allied | allies]] or [[Neutral]] elements, whether represented by Models or Markers.

=== [[:Category:BS Attack | BS Attack ]] ===
The use of this Special Skill or piece of Equipment is a form of [[BS Attack]].

=== [[:Category:CC Attack | CC Attack ]] ===
The use of this Special Skill or piece of Equipment is a form of [[CC Attack]].

=== [[:Category:CC Special Skill | CC Special Skill ]] ===
This Skill can only be used when the user is in [[Silhouette contact]] with the target. Any MODs the Skill may provide can be combined with other CC Special Skills, and they work equally during the [[Active Turn]] and the [[Reactive Turn]], unless the Skill states otherwise.

=== [[:Category:Comms Attack | Comms Attack ]] ===
The use of this weapon, Special Skill, or piece of Equipment is an Attack that cannot be avoided with the [[Dodge]] Special Short Skill, but instead with the [[Reset]] Short Skill. [[Partial Cover]] has no effect on Weapons, Special Skills or pieces of Equipment possessing this Trait.

=== [[:Category:Comms Equipment | Comms Equipment ]] ===
This Equipment is vulnerable to the effects of certain [[Hacking Program]]s and [[Ammunition]].

=== [[:Category:Hackable | Hackable ]] ===
{{image | name=eng-hackable-256.png | style= 2eminline }} A [[Trooper]], [[Peripheral]], weapon, or piece of Equipment with the [[Hackable | Hackable Characteristic]] or Label can be targeted by both allies and enemies using certain [[Hacking Program]]s.

=== [[:Category:Hostile | Hostile ]] ===
A game element with its own Attributes that does not belong to the [[Army List]] of any of the players. It is considered an [[Enemy]] by all the players and it is able to declare and receive Attacks.

=== [[:Category:Marker | Marker ]] ===
This Label indicates that Troopers, Weapons, or pieces of Equipment can be represented by a Marker, instead of a Miniature or a Token.

=== [[:Category:Movement | Movement ]] ===
The use of this Skill or Equipment is a form of [[Movement Module | Movement]].

=== [[:Category:NFB | Negative Feedback (NFB) ]] ===
The use of this Special Skill or piece of Equipment is incompatible with the use of any other Special Skill or piece of Equipment having this same Label or Trait. 

The activation of any Special Skill, Equipment, Hacking Program, special rule, etc. with Negative Feedback will automatically cancel and override any other Special Skill, Equipment, Hacking Program, etc. with Negative Feedback the Trooper may have, until the effects of the new Special Skill, Equipment, etc. are canceled or until it is voluntarily deactivated. 

Therefore, when using an Order, a Trooper will only be allowed to have one active piece of Equipment, Hacking Program, or Special Skill with the Negative Feedback Trait.

=== [[:Category:No LoF | No LoF ]] ===
This Skill does not require [[LoF]] to the target.

=== [[:Category:No Roll | No Roll ]] ===
This weapon, Special Skill, or piece of Equipment works automatically and does not require a [[Roll]]. If it provides a result, it will be a fixed one which will be shown between brackets.

=== [[:Category:Null | Null ]] ===
A Game [[State]] with this Label indicates that, in this state, the Trooper will not provide an [[Order]], or [[Victory Points]], to the player.

=== [[:Category:Obligatory | Obligatory ]] ===
The use of this Special Skill or Equipment is compulsory and cannot be waived.

=== [[:Category:Optional | Optional ]] ===
