Labels and Traits describe game features and particularities of both Skills and weaponry and Equipment.

== Labels ==

Labels describe a series of defining aspects of Skills, weapons, and pieces of Equipment for a quick reference. They are the following:

=== Airborne Deployment (AD) === 
This label encompasses all the Skills that are related to Airborne Infantry. Any rule mentioning Airborne Deployment will affect all the Skills that have this Label. 
 
=== Attack === 
The use of this Special Skill or piece of Equipment is considered an Attack. Remember that '''you cannot declare attacks against allies or [[Neutral]]''' elements, whether represented by Models or Markers.
 
{{n4}}
=== Attack Tactic ===
This is an aggressive Tactic.

=== Assignable (W)===
{{n4annex}}
When deploying its owner during the [[Deployment Phase]], and '''only''' then, this weapon or piece of Equipment can be assigned to Troopers who possess the [[Transmutation]] (W) Special Skill, and are present on the game table as a Model (excluding Troopers using [[Airborne Deployment]], [[Hidden Deployment]], [[Impersonation State]], etc.).

A Trooper possessing the Transmutation (W) Special Skill cannot receive more than one weapon or piece of Equipment of the same type with the Assignable Label.

Weapons and pieces of Equipment with the Assignable Label must be placed and remain in base contact with their '''user''', the assigned Trooper, moving along with them.

These weapons and pieces of Equipment are considered a Game State Token rather than a Model.

=== Comms Attack === 
{{c1}}The use of this weapon, Special Skill, or piece of Equipment is considered an Attack that '''cannot''' be avoided with the [[Dodge]] Short Skill, but instead with the [[Reset]] Short Skill.

=== Hostile ===

The use this Special Skill or piece of Equipment is incompatible with the use of any other Special Skill or piece of Equipment having this same Label or Trait.

The activation of any Special Skill, Equipment, [[Hacking Program]], special rule, etc. with Negative Feedback will automatically cancel and override any other Special Skill, Equipment, Hacking Program, etc. with Negative Feedback the Trooper may have, until the effects of the new Special Skill, Equipment, etc. are canceled or until it is voluntarily Deactivated.

Therefore, when using an Order, a Trooper will only be allowed to have one active piece of Equipment, Hacking Program, or Special Skill with the Negative Feedback Trait.
