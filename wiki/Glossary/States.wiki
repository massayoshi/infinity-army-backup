{{n5-section-game-states}}


A State is a game rule that represents the different conditions, positive or negative, in which a Trooper or Game Element can be in, in Infinity.

All the different States are cumulative, and all of them have Activation and Cancellation procedures. States are represented in the form of State Tokens.

States that are considered [[Null]] are marked in red, so they are more easily identified.


{{remember}}
States can modify various [[Attributes]]. If a Trooper is in several States that affect the same Attribute, their effects are cumulative.

If a Trooper receives and removes [[Wound]]s or [[States]] in the same Order, the positive effect is always applied first, followed by the negative effect. 

For example, if an [[Engineer]] cancels a Trooper’s [[IMM-A]] State at the same time that the same Trooper is hit by a Riotstopper, the Engineer’s WIP Roll to cancel the Trooper’s IMM-A State is made first, then the Trooper makes their PH-6 [[Saving Roll]] against the Riotstopper’s [[PARA]] Special Ammunition. In this way, the original IMM-A Status could be canceled and a new one inflicted in the same Order.{{erratahighblock-end}}
