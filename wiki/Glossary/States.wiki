{{n5-section-game-states}}


A State is a game rule that represents the different conditions, positive or negative, in which a Trooper or Game Element can be in, in Infinity.

All the different States are cumulative, and all of them have Activation and Cancellation procedures. States are represented in the form of State Tokens.

States that are considered [[Null]] are marked in red, so they are more easily identified.


{{remember}}
States can modify various [[Attributes]]. If a Trooper is in several States that affect the same Attribute, their effects are cumulative.
