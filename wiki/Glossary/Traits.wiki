Traits are the special features of certain weapons and pieces of Equipment.

Traits are commonly given to Common and Special Skills, or to specific effects that make these rules more unique. Some are pretty obvious, and their names describe what their effects are, nevertheless, a list of the different Traits is provided to make them easier to identify:

{{n4}}
=== Anti-Materiel ===
This weapon's Special Ammunition can affect structures and pieces of scenery.
{{n4end}}

=== ARM = 0 ===
This weapon or piece of Equipment reduces the '''[[ARM]]''' Attribute of the Target to 0 when a [[Saving Roll]] is required. {{seefaq | Ammunition and Traits that target one Attribute will not work if the other Attribute is chosen.}}

=== ARO ===
This weapon or piece of Equipment is only usable in ARO.

{{n4}}
=== BioWeapon===
{{n4annex}}
This weapon only affects those targets possessing the Wounds (W) Attribute.

=== Boost ===
A weapon possessing this Trait applies the [[Boost]] rule, activating when an enemy Model declares or executes an Order or ARO in its ZoC.
{{n4end}}

=== BTS = 0 ===
This weapon or piece of Equipment reduces the '''[[BTS]]''' Attribute of the Target to 0 when a [[Saving Roll]] is required. {{seefaq | Ammunition and Traits that target one Attribute will not work if the other Attribute is chosen.}}

=== [[Burst]] (B) ===
This indicates the number of dice the player must roll when using the weapon or piece of Equipment. 

{{n4}}
=== Burst: Single Target ===
This weapon can only choose a single target for all shots of the Burst.
{{n4end}}

=== CC ===
This weapon can be used when making [[CC Attacks]].

=== Concealed ===
This weapon or piece of Equipment uses the effects of the [[Camouflage]] Special Skill. Refer to the description of the weapon or Equipment for more details. Camouflage Markers concealing a weapon or a piece of Equipment have a Silhouette (S) value of 2.

=== Continuous Damage ===
After failing a [[Saving Roll]], the target will lose 1 point from its [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute and it will have to keep making [[Saving Rolls]] '''until it passes''' a Saving Roll or until it ends up in [[Dead]] State.

A '''Critical''' hit with a weapon with this Trait forces the target to make an additional Saving Roll. This extra Saving Roll doesn’t apply the Continuous Damage Trait.  

=== Deployable ===
This weapon or piece of Equipment may be deployed on the battlefield, thus becoming an element independent of its carrier. Deployable weapons and pieces of Equipment have their own profiles and their own Attributes, and they may be chosen as a target during the game.

=== Direct Template ===
This weapon or piece of Equipment uses the [[Direct Template]] rules, firing the Template indicated in brackets.

=== Disposable ===
This weapon or Equipment has a limited amount of ammunition or uses, and one is expended every time you declare its use, regardless of the success or failure of the Roll involved, or if a Skill has been declared illegally. The profile indicates, by means of a figure in brackets after the Disposable trait, the number of uses for that weapon or Equipment. Once all the uses available are expended, the Trooper, or the item if the Trooper has several Disposable weapons or Equipment, will be in [[Unloaded]] State. {{seefaq}}

{{n4}}
=== Double Shot ===
This weapon or piece of Equipment can apply a +1 MOD to its [[Burst]] value. If it also possesses the [[#Disposable|Disposable]] (2) Trait, this Burst MOD can only be applied if both uses remain unspent. Applying this MOD will expend both uses, putting the Trooper in Unloaded State. {{seefaq}}

=== Impact Template ===
This weapon or piece of Equipment places a [[Template]] on the point of impact, firing the Template indicated in brackets.

=== Indiscriminate ===
This weapon or piece of Equipment is usable or deployable even if there is a [[Camouflaged|Camouflage]] Marker in its Area of Effect, and even if there is no valid target nearby.

=== Intuitive Attack ===
This weapon can be used to make [[Intuitive Attack]]s.
{{n4end}}

=== Non-Lethal ===
{{c1}}
This weapon or piece of Equipment uses a Type of Ammunition that does not cause Damage, or that does not require its target to make a [[Saving Roll]] when hit.
{{c1end}}{{n4}}This weapon, piece of Equipment or Hacking Program loads an ammunition type that doesn’t cause the target to lose points of its [[Wounds]]/[[STR]] Attribute, or doesn’t require the target to make a [[Saving Roll]] when hit. {{seefaq}}

=== Perimeter ===
When declaring [[Place Deployable]], the player will apply the [[Place_Deployable#Deployable_and_Perimeter|Deployable and Perimeter]] rule, placing the weapon or piece of Equipment '''completely''' inside the [[ZoC]] of the Trooper, instead of in [[Silhouette contact]].
{{n4end}}

=== Prior Deployment ===
You must place this weapon or piece of Equipment on the game table during the [[Deployment Phase]].

{{n4}}
=== Reflective ===
The effects of this weapon or piece of Equipment will be also applied to troopers equipped with a [[Multispectral Visor]] of any Level, or any other piece of Equipment that specifies the same.

=== Silent ===
If you use this weapon or piece of Equipment to make an Attack while outside the target's [[LoF]], that target cannot react with a [[Dodge]] or apply the [[Alert]] rule unless he survives the Attack (that is, isn't in a [[Null]] state after the Attack is resolved).
Additionally, enemies without LoF in whose [[Zone of Control]] the Attack took place or was declared cannot declare AROs or apply the Alert rule unless the target survives the Attack. This means that these enemies must delay their ARO declaration until after the Attack is resolved.

=== Speculative Attack ===
This weapon can be used to make [[Speculative Attack]]s. {{seefaq | Cannot be combined with BS Attack (Guided).}}
{{n4end}}

=== State ===
This weapon or piece of Equipment causes its target to enter a specific Game [[State]]. The Game State it causes will be indicated in the profile of the weapon, Program, or piece of Equipment. {{seefaq}}

{{n4}}
=== Suppressive Fire (SF) ===
This weapon allows the user to engage in [[Suppressive Fire]], substituting its usual profile with the SF Mode profile.
{{n4end}}

=== Targetless ===
This weapon utilizes a Special Ammunition capable of firing without designating an enemy as a target.

{{n4}}
=== Technical Weapon ===
This weapon can make [[BS Attack]]s, but uses the [[WIP]] Attribute in place of [[BS]]. When using this weapon, consider all rules and MODs that would affect the trooper's BS as affecting his WIP Attribute instead. However, the BS Attack (Shock) Skill and [[Fireteam]] Bonuses cannot be applied when using a Technical Weapon.

=== Throwing Weapon ===
This weapon can make [[BS Attack]]s, but uses the [[PH]] Attribute in place of [[BS]]. When using this weapon, consider all rules and MODs that would affect the trooper's BS as affecting his PH Attribute instead.
{{n4end}}

=== Zone of Control (ZC) ===
The range of this weapon or piece of Equipment is equivalent to the user's [[Zone of Control]] (8 inches).


== FAQs & Errata ==

{{faqbox |
type = faq |
title = N4 FAQ |
version = 1.0, Jan 2021 |
q = Q: How does Bioimmunity interact with Ammunition and Traits that reduce the Saving Roll Attribute, for example AP or E/M Ammunition, or ARM=0? |
a = A: AP Ammunition is tied to the Saving Roll Attribute listed in a weapon’s profile. If Bioimmunity is used to make the Saving Roll against a different Attribute, that Attribute will not be halved.
In the same way, if Bioimmunity is used against a hit by E/M Ammunition to make the Saving Rolls against ARM, the ARM value will not be halved.
The ARM=0 Trait only applies if the Saving Roll is made against the ARM Attribute, and vice-versa for the BTS=0 Trait. |

{{faqbox |

q = Q: How does the Disposable Trait interact with Burst values higher than 1? |
a = A: Each additional Burst uses up a Disposable use. For example, a Trooper with a Panzerfaust (a two- use weapon with B 1) and BS Attack (+1B) must make an attack with B 2, consuming in a single Order the two projectiles available in the Panzerfaust, so the Panzerfaust will be unloaded and the player must place an Unloaded Token next to the Trooper. |

a = A: Yes. It is a Face to Face Roll - Immunity (Total) doesn't take effect until you've been hit, which is after you've made the Face to Face Roll. |
