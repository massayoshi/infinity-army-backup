In Infinity it is important to define which game elements belong to a playersâ€™ side, and which belong to no side. This determines if those game elements are capable of being attacked, and if so, from whom these attacks may come. 

The Alignment adjectives help the players know the extent of the rules over certain game elements.


=== Ally === 
Game elements that belong to the player's [[Army List]], or to those of their teammates if the game is played in pairs or groups.

=== Enemy === 
Game elements that belong to the opposing player's [[Army List]] or to any of their teammates if the game is played in pairs or groups.

=== Hostile === 
A game element with its own [[Attributes]] that does not belong to the [[Army List]] of any of the players. It is considered an Enemy by all the players and is able to declare and receive [[Attacks]].

=== Neutral === 
Game elements with [[Attributes]] that do not belong to the [[Army Lists]] of either player.
