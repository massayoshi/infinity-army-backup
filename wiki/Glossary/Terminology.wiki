This set of rules features a collection of terms which refer to very specific game element that help to clarify the extent of the rules.


=== Attributes ===
[[Attribute]]s are a series of numeric values that describe a Trooper's or game element's basic capabilities. In game terms, these are used to make [[Roll]]s and calculate the success or failure of attempted actions.

=== [[Deployable]] Equipment ===
Game element with [[Attribute]]s, which belongs to the [[Army List]] of any of the players and is capable of performing a Special Skill or Trait. This element may also be designated as a target and receive [[Attack]]s.

=== [[Deployable]] Weapon ===
Game element with [[Attribute]]s that may belong to the [[Army List]] of a player and is capable of performing and receiving [[Attack]]s.

=== Marker ===
Game element with [[Attribute]]s represented on the table with a Marker as specified by a Special Skill, Weapon or Equipment.

=== Model ===
Game element with [[Attribute]]s represented on the table by a miniature.

=== [[Peripheral]] ===
Special category of [[Trooper]] that is unable to contribute or spend [[Orders]] by itself and, therefore, takes no space in the [[Army List]]. It is activated when its Controller, the Trooper on which it depends, spends an Order, replicating their actions. The Cost of a Peripheral is shown in its own Troop Profile but is also added to its Controller's Cost.

=== Scenery Element===
Game element that recreates the scenarios and serves as a prop on the game table. On certain occasions, they may have [[Attribute]]s or become a valid target.

=== Target===
Game element capable of being targeted by [[Attack]]s and effects from Skills or Equipment.

=== Token ===
Game element that represents a piece of [[Deployable]] Equipment or a [[Deployable]] Weapon.

=== Trooper ===
Game element with [[Attribute]]s which belongs to the [[Army List]] of any player, able to contribute and spend [[Orders]], as well as declaring and receiving [[Attack]]s.

=== [[Unit Profile]] ===
Represents the set of Troopers that form each Unit in Infinity. Indicates the numerical values that determine each Trooper's [[Attribute]]s. The Unit Profile also indicates the Characteristics, Special Skills, Equipment, and Armor of each Trooper.

=== Victory Points===
The combined [[Cost]] of the player's Troopers who are in a non-[[Null]] state.
