{{skillbox |black| RETREAT! | }}
{{activation}}
* If at the beginning of the [[Player Turn]], the sum of the [[Victory Points]] of the player is equal or less than 25% of the points available for building the [[Army List]], then their army enters a state of [[Retreat Situation|Retreat!]]
{{effects}}
* An army in Retreat! is automatically considered to be in a state of [[Loss of Lieutenant]].
* As long as the army is in Retreat!, its owner cannot name a new [[Lieutenant]]. If the state of Retreat! is cancelled and the army has a Lieutenant, then the Loss of Lieutenant state is cancelled as well.
* When Retreat! State is declared at the beginning of a player's Active Turn, that player places a Retreat! Token (RETREAT!) beside each of their surviving troops. 
* Troops with a Retreat! Token (RETREAT!) can only use [[Short Movement Skill]]s, [[Cautious Movement]], [[Dodge]] or [[Reset]] (or any Special Skills that explicitly say so). 
: In a Retreat! situation the [[Impetuous Phase]] of the Player Turn is not applied. So, [[Impetuous]] or [[Frenzy]] Troopers cannot be activated in the Impetuous Phase.
: Troopers in [[Holoecho State|Holoecho]] or [[HoloMask State]], or any [[Marker]] State, cancel the State when they enter Retreat! State.
* This State does not interfere with Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, which will remain functioning normally.
* Troopers with the Special Skills [[Courage]], [[Religious Troop]], [[Veteran]] or any other Special Skill that protects them from the effects of Retreat! State ignore all effects of Retreat! State.
* In a Retreat! situation, all Troopers who exit the game table via the widest side of their [[Deployment Zone]] are considered to have survived the battle and can be counted as Victory Points by their owner.
* When a player in Retreat! has lost or evacuated all Troopers in their Army List, the game ends (unless the specific end-game conditions of the scenario being played indicate otherwise).
{{cancellation}}
* The Retreat! State of a Trooper can be cancelled by spending a [[Command Token]]. That Trooper will ignore the effects of Retreat! State until the end of the game. 
* At the beginning of each of their Active Turns, players can make a count of their surviving troops. If the point cost of the survivors is more than the 25% threshold–because an Unconscious troop was restored to combat readiness, for example–then Retreat! State is cancelled and the Retreat! Tokens (RETREAT!) are removed.
