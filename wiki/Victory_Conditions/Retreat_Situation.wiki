== Retreat! ==
Retreat! allows Infinity players to continue to play as long as there are survivors on the table, fighting to their last man to turn the game around at the last minute.

In game terms, each player, at the beginning of their [[Active Turn]], during the [[Tactical Phase]], must make a count of their [[Victory Points]]. For this purpose, consider any Troopers that have not yet been placed on the table ([[Airborne Deployment]], [[Hidden Deployment]]â€¦) as survivors. If the sum of the Victory Points is equal to or less than 25% of the points available for building the Army List, then that army enters a state of Retreat!.
