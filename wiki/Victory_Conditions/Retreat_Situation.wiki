== Retreat! ==
Retreat! allows Infinity players to continue to play as long as there are survivors on the table, fighting to their last man to turn the game around at the last minute.

In game terms, each player, at the beginning of their [[Active Turn]], during the [[Tactical Phase]], must make a count of their [[Victory Points]]. For this purpose, consider any Troopers that have not yet been placed on the table ([[Airborne Deployment]], [[Hidden Deployment]]…) as survivors. If the sum of the Victory Points is equal to or less than 25% of the points available for building the Army List, then that army enters a state of Retreat!.

|- 
| If a player’s surviving troops add up to 25% or less of the [[Army List]] points, that player is declared in Retreat!.
|- 
| The army is in [[Loss of Lieutenant]].
|- 
| All troops (save Special Skill exceptions) become Irregular as per the Loss of Lieutenant rules. Place an [[Irregular Order]] Token beside each of them.
|- 
| Place a Retreat! Token beside each affected troop on the battlefield.
|- 
| Troops with a Retreat! Token can only declare Short Movement Skills, [[Cautious Movement]], [[Dodge]] and [[Reset]].
|- 
| Troops with a Retreat! Token who exit the table through the broad side of their Deployment Zone will be counted as Victory Points.
|- 
| At the start of each turn, count the surviving troops again. If they add up to more than 25% of the Army List, cancel Retreat!.
