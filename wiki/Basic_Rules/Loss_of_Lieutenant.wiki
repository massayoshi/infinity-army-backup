Despite their training and their constant connection with Mission Control, losing a team leader to enemy fire or system failure can wreak havoc on the discipline of soldiers, creating a moment of confusion in which everyone is left to their own devices, without a coordinated tactical approach. This situation is usually temporary, and order reigns again once the next rung in the chain of command steps up or Mission Control chooses a new leader.

* If, during the Tactical Phase of the Active Turn, the Active Player lacks a [[Lieutenant]] because they did not deploy or the previous Lieutenant is currently in a Null ([[Unconscious]], [[Dead]], [[Sepsitorized]]...) or [[Isolated]] State, then a situation of Loss of Lieutenant is automatically declared.

{{effects}}
* While an army is in a Loss of Lieutenant situation, all Troopers in its Army List are [[Irregular]].
{{cancellation}}
* At the end of the playerâ€™s Turn, they must appoint a new Lieutenant, at no cost, which cancels the Loss of Lieutenant situation. The new Lieutenant gains the [[Lieutenant]] Special Skill, with no additional abilities. The identity of this new Lieutenant is still considered [[Private Information]].

{{important-start}}
Troopers whose Unit Profile has the [[Irregular]] Characteristic or the [[REM]] Troop Type cannot be appointed as Lieutenant.
