Despite their training and their constant connection with Mission Control, losing a team leader to enemy fire or system failure can wreak havoc on the discipline of soldiers, creating a moment of confusion in which everyone is left to their own devices, without a coordinated tactical approach. This situation is usually temporary, and order reigns again once the next rung in the chain of command steps up or Mission Control chooses a new leader.


{{css_skillbox |black| LOSS OF LIEUTENANT }}
{{activation}}
* If, during the '''[[Tactical Phase]]''' of the Active Turn, the Active Player lacks a [[Lieutenant]] because they did not deploy it on the game table (as a Model or as a Marker) or the previous Lieutenant is currently in a '''[[Null]]''' ([[Unconscious]], [[Dead]], [[Sepsitorized]]...) or '''[[Isolated]]''' State, then a Loss of Lieutenant situation is automatically declared.
{{effects}}
* While an army is in a Loss of Lieutenant situation, all Troopers in its [[Army List]] are [[Irregular]].
{{cancellation}}
* At the end of the playerâ€™s Turn, they must appoint a new Lieutenant, at no cost, which cancels the Loss of Lieutenant situation. The new Lieutenant gains the Lieutenant Special Skill, with no additional abilities. The identity of this new Lieutenant is still considered [[Private Information]].
{{css_skillbox-end }}


{{important-start}}
Troopers whose Unit Profile has the [[Irregular]] Characteristic or the [[REM]] [[Troop Type]] cannot be appointed as Lieutenant.

'''[[Chain of Command]]'''

[...]
* The user automatically becomes the new Lieutenant of the [[Army List]], gaining the Lieutenant Special Skill with no extra abilities.
* The Loss of Lieutenant check is successful this Turn.


'''[[Mnemonica]]'''
* In order to activate this Special Skill, the user must enter a [[Null]] State.
[...]
* The user may transfer his own [[WIP]] Attribute value and the Mnemonica Special Skill to another Trooper in the same army. That Trooper must be on the battlefield in the form of a Model or Marker and have either a [[Cube]] or the [[REM]] Troop Type. If the user has the [[Lieutenant]] Special Skill this is also transferred, including any additional abilities and MODs such as (+1 Order).
