In game terms, all Troopers occupy an unvarying volume on the table. This volume is cylinder-shaped, with its width determined by the base size and its height by the type of Trooper.

Silhouette Templates are a game aid designed to help players determine the in-game volume and height and width of a Trooper.

If doubts about the volume of a Trooper arise during a game, players can use the Silhouette Templates to decide exactly what cylinder-shaped space it takes up on the game table. Any part of the model that juts out of the perimeter of its base is ignored for game purposes.

Depending on their unit type, Troopers have in their Profile an Attribute called [[Silhouette Attribute|Silhouette]] (S) that indicates which Silhouette Template they should use.
