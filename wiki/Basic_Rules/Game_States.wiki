‘State’ is a game term for each of the altered conditions, beneficial or not, that a Trooper or game element might find itself in.

Each State has a specific game effect, as well as individual methods of activation and cancellation. States in Infinity are cumulative, and are indicated by placing State Tokens next to an affected Trooper.
