Troopers have an awareness of their surroundings. '''Zone of Control''' (ZoC) is defined as an imaginary cylinder with a radius of 8 inches from the outer edge of the Trooper’s [[Silhouette]], extending 8 inches up from the top of the Silhouette and 8 inches down from the bottom of the Silhouette.


=== Zone of Control and AROs===
Enemies entering or acting inside the Zone of Control of a Trooper while remaining outside that Trooper’s [[LoF]] can be reacted to.

Players can check the Zone of Control (ZoC). Measurements must always be made from the Active Trooper, checking a maximum of 8 inches from any point along their path. If there are Reactive Troopers or Game Elements within the Zone of Control (ZoC) of the Active Trooper, they can declare an [[ARO]] (see [[Order Expenditure Sequence]]).
