Troopers have an awareness of their surroundings. '''Zone of Control''' (ZoC) is defined as an imaginary cylinder with a radius of 8 inches from the outer edge of the Trooper’s [[Silhouette]], extending 8 inches up from the top of the Silhouette and 8 inches down from the bottom of the Silhouette.


=== Zone of Control and AROs===
Enemies entering or acting inside the Zone of Control of a Trooper while remaining outside that Trooper’s [[LoF]] can be reacted to.

Players can check the Zone of Control (ZoC). Measurements must always be made from the Active Trooper, checking a maximum of 8 inches from any point along their path. If there are Reactive Troopers or Game Elements within the Zone of Control (ZoC) of the Active Trooper, they can declare an [[ARO]] (see [[Order Expenditure Sequence]]).

Maybe you’re wondering when, or how, exactly you can check the Zone of Control. It’s easy: once the Active Model has been placed at the end point of its movement, the two players can measure the Zone of Control along the entire route that was traced on the game board, from its starting point to its final position, these both included. This is the most natural and convenient way to check the Zone of Control.
