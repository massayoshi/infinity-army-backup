Players use [[Orders]] to activate [[Troopers]] and have them perform actions in the form of [[Skills]] ([[Move]], [[Jump]], [[CC Attack]]...). Depending on their complexity and the in-game time taken, Skills are divided into:
* '''Basic Short Skills''': These skills are '''[[Move]]''', '''[[Discover]]''', and '''[[Idle]]'''. They can be declared twice, or can be combined with a different Basic Short Skill in the same Order. For instance, you could use an Order to Move and Discover. They can also be combined with a Short Skill.
* '''Short Skills''': Most of the Skills available in Infinity are Short Skills. They can '''only''' be combined in an Order with a Basic Short Skill. They '''cannot''' be declared twice or be combined with other Short Skills.
* '''Long Skills''': These Skills employ one whole Order and cannot be combined in any way.

You can check the [[Orders and AROs Reference Chart]].

Therefore, spending an Order allows the activated Trooper to declare a maximum of two Skills, choosing from one of the following combinations and always declared in the order shown:

* 1 Basic Short Skill + 1 Basic Short Skill.
* 1 Basic Short Skill + 1 Short Skill.
* 1 Long Skill (which activates the Trooper and expends the whole Order).


{{Important-start}}
Even if declared one after the other, both Skills in a single Order are performed simultaneously. For example, if you declare [[Move]] plus [[BS Attack]], (the Short Skill that Troopers use to fire their weapons), you can make the BS Attack at any point during the declared movement route, and not necessarily at the beginning or end of that route.

The type, status, and expenditure of any Order ([[Orders_and_the_Order_Pool#Types_of_Orders | Regular, Irregular, Tactical, the Lieutenant Order]], which [[Combat Group]] it belongs to, whether it has been spent or not...) is [[Open Information]]. Players must place the Tokens for each and every one of their Orders in a visible place on the gaming table, and they must inform their opponent every time they spend an Order to activate a Trooper, even if it is the Lieutenant Order.
