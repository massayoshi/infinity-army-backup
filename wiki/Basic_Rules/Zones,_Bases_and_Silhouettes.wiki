This ruleset frequently uses terms that define the interaction between Troopers and other game elements.


== Base Contact/Silhouette Contact ==
The Troopers are positioned with their [[Silhouette]]s in contact with each other. This term also applies when the Trooper’s Silhouette is in contact with a game element that may or may not have a base, like a piece of terrain.

A Trooper is always in Silhouette contact with themselves.

== Inside ==
To consider a Trooper to be inside a defined game area (for example a [[Zone of Control]], a [[Zero Visibility Zone]], or a [[Difficult Terrain Zone]]) its [[Silhouette]] must be in contact with the zone, or be at least partially within the zone.


== Totally Inside ==
When a rule specifies “totally inside”, then the Trooper’s entire [[Silhouette]] must be inside the defined area.
