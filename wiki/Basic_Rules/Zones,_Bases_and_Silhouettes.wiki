This ruleset frequently uses terms that define the interaction between Troopers and other game elements. 


== Base Contact/Silhouette Contact ==
The Troopers are positioned with their Silhouettes in contact with each other. This term also applies when the Trooper's ''[[Silhouette]]'' is in contact with a game element that may or may not have a base, like a piece of terrain.

== Inside ==
To consider a ''[[Trooper]]'' to be inside a defined game area (for example a ''[[Zone of Control]]'', a ''[[Zero Visibility Zone]]'', or a ''[[Difficult Terrain Zone]]'') its ''[[Silhouette]]'' must be in contact with the zone, or be at least partially within the zone.


== Totally Inside ==
When a rule specifies “totally inside”, then the ''[[Trooper]]'s'' entire ''[[Silhouette]]'' must be inside the defined area.
