Information about [[Army List]]s in an Infinity game can be either Open or Private.

'''Consider any piece of information on a player's Army List that is not explicitly Private as Open and knowable to all.''' You must share Open Information about your Army List while you deploy your [[Models]], [[Markers]] and [[Tokens]] during the [[Deployment Phase]], and also any time your opponent asks during the game.

Private Information is information you can keep to yourself that your opponent cannot ask about. Your Private Information remains secret until a specific game event forces you to disclose it.

You are required to write down {{erratahighlight}}or record{{erratahighlight-end}} all Private Information before the game starts to show your opponent if necessary.

These pieces of information are Private in Infinity:

* Your Troopers' [[Cost]] and [[SWC]].
* The presence of Troopers possessing the [[Combat Jump]] or [[Parachutist]] Special Skill.
* The presence of [[Hidden Deployment]] Troopers.
* The presence of troopers disguised by [[HoloMask]].
* The identity of Troops with [[Chain of Command]] or [[Counterintelligence]].
* The contents of your [[Markers]].
* The identity of your [[Lieutenant]].  
When the game ends, an [[Army List]]'s Private Information becomes Open Information.
