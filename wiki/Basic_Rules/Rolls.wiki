Infinity uses 20-sided dice (commonly known as '''d20''') to determine whether specific actions are successful. For example, players roll dice to find out whether their Troopers succeed in hitting their target in ranged combat, hacking into enemy systems, discovering a hidden enemy, etc.

Infinity's game mechanics revolve around two types of d20 rolls: '''[[#Normal Rolls | Normal Rolls]]''' and '''[[Face to Face Rolls]].

=== Successful Roll ===
Troopers and game Elements have a series of [[Attributes]] that define their capabilities to perform different game actions. Rolls are made against the '''Success Value (SV)''', the numeric value resulting from applying the relevant Modifiers (both negative and positive) to the Attribute used for the Skill.

To find out if a Skill has succeeded, a d20 is rolled and the result is compared to the Success Value. '''Any result that is equal to or lower than''' the Success Value means that the Skill was successful.

== Modifiers (MOD) ==
In most cases, the circumstances of an action apply [[Modifiers Explained | Modifiers ('''MODs''')]] to the relevant Attribute before a roll is made. MODs, by increasing or decreasing the numeric value of an [[Attribute]], denote the difficulty of the Skill at hand. A positive MOD applies when the Skill performed is easier than usual, and a negative MOD makes the Skill harder than usual.

{{important-start}}
Whenever a rule mentions the value of an [[Attribute]], consider it to mean the Success Value, obtained after applying all MODs.{{important-end}}

{{greybox-start | Maximum Modifier}}
The sum total of the Modifiers applied to a Roll can never exceed +12 or -12. Any Modifier that adds up to more than +12 or less than -12 is ignored and replaced by the maximum MOD of +12 or -12, as appropriate.
{{greybox-end}}


The most commonly used MODs are:
* '''[[Range]]:''' can modify the [[BS]], [[PH]], and [[WIP]] Attributes.
* '''[[Cover]]:''' can modify [[BS]], [[PH]], [[WIP]], and [[Saving Rolls]]. 
* '''[[Skills]], [[Weapons]] and [[Equipment]]:''' can modify several different [[Attributes]].


Different Modifiers (MOD) may appear in the '''[[Unit Profiles]]'''.

{{remember-start}}
Rounding:

In Infinity, any time a number (a result on a die, an [[Attribute]], a MOD...) is divided and rounded to an integer, it is always rounded up. For example, half of 5 (5 / 2 = 2.5) would be 3.
{{remember-end}}


=== Maximum Modifier Example ===
{{greybox-start | Maximum Modifier Example}}
{{image | name=n5/n5-eng-maximum-modifier.jpg | style=fullborder }}

{{n5_weapon_single}}
{{n5_weaponrow|Combi Rifle|+3|+3|-3|-3|-6|-6|--|7|3|N|ARM|1|[[Suppressive Fire]]}}
|}

Trooper A declares: [[Move]] + [[BS Attack]] with his Combi Rifle. His BS Attack will apply the following MODs: 
* -6 for Trooper B's [[Mimetism]].
* -3 for [[Cover]]. 
* -6 for [[Range]]. 
The total sum of Modifiers is -15.
Given that the maximum MOD is -12, the Success Value (SV) will be 13 - 12 = 1.
{{greybox-end}}


== Criticals ==
'''Criticals''' represent the improved outcomes of actions that resulted in an exceptional success. When the result on the die matches the Success Value (remember: the value of the Attribute with all MODs applied), the action is a Critical success. The goal of the action was achieved in the best possible way. A perfect success, congratulations!

In [[Face to Face Rolls]], '''Criticals''' always win, regardless of the rival's results. If both players get one or more Criticals, the Face to Face Roll is a tie and both Troopers are considered to have failed

== Success Value Below 1 ==
Negative MODs can sometimes cause the Success Value to drop below 1 for an action. In these cases, the player does not roll the dice, and the Roll '''fails automatically'''.


== Attributes and Success Value Above 20 ==
IIn other cases, an [[Attribute]] can be higher than 20, or the total positive MOD added to the Attribute can make the Success Value exceed 20. 

A Success Value over 20 increase the chances of rolling a Critical success. The amount over 20 indicates the possible results on the die roll that, in addition to a 20, will give a Critical success. For instance, with a Success Value of 23, a Critical success is achieved when rolling a 20, but also when rolling a 1, 2, or 3 on the die.


=== Example of an Attribute and Success Value Over 20 ===
{{greybox-start | Example of an Attribute and Success Value Over 20}}
A Trooper has a Close Combat ([[CC]]) Attribute value of 24. Therefore, as their Success Value is 24, any result in a Normal Roll is a success. In addition, any roll of 20, 1, 2, 3, or 4 on the die is a Critical success.
{{greybox-end}}


== Normal Roll ==
Normal Rolls are the most common, basic dice rolls in Infinity. This roll is used when a Trooper is not facing off against an enemy, but instead must check if they successfully use an uncontested or passively contested Skill (such as trying to [[Discover]] a [[camouflaged]] [[enemy]] or healing an [[allied | ally]] by means of the [[Doctor]] Special Skill).

To make a '''Normal Roll''' and find out if '''a Trooper is successful''' when performing a Skill, simply roll one d20 and compare the result against the Success Value of the relevant [[Attribute]] of the Trooper performing the action. If the '''result''' on the die is '''equal to or lower than the Success Value''', the Skill is successful, and the Trooper achieves its goal.


=== Normal Roll Example ===
{{greybox-start | Normal Roll Example}}
The Fennec Fusilier’s [[BS]] Attribute is 12 and he has to make a Normal BS Roll with a -3 MOD, with a BS Success Value of 9, so he rolls a d20 and gets an 8. Since the Fennec’s Success Value is 9, the roll is a success. Later on, this Fusilier tries another Normal BS Roll, but this time he gets a 12. As the Success Value is 9, the Fennec fails the roll.
