Distances on the game table are measured in inches, using a tape measure or ruler. 

When measuring the distance between two Troopers, players must measure between the '''closest parts of their Silhouettes'''. 

To determine what the distance is between two objects or scenery items, players must measure a straight line between them.

In Infinity, it is advised to use the base for measuring distances. By doing so, it is easier to determine the reference point for the distance and speed up the game. Only on rare occasions it will be necessary to use the Silhouette Template to know the exact range between two Troopers.

As a general rule, the Skills that compose an Order must be declared before measuring (see the [[Order Expenditure Sequence]]).
