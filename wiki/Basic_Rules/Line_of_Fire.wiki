Line of Fire (LoF) is the criterion by which players determine whether a Trooper can see its target. The Line of Fire (LoF) is an imaginary straight line that joins any point of the volume of a Model, Token, Marker or valid target to any point of the volume of another.

Remember that the volume of a Model, Marker, or Token is determined by the value of its [[Silhouette]] [[Attribute]]. 

In Infinity, Troopers have a Line of Fire (LoF) angle of 180&deg;, matching the front half of their base, as shown on the base of the miniatures.

For a Trooper to be able to draw LoF to its target, it must meet these conditions:

* The target must be totally or partially within the Trooper's front 180˚ arc, unless some [[Special Skill]] or piece of [[Equipment]] ignores this restriction.
* The Trooper must be able to see part of the volume of its target, with a minimum size of 3x3mm.
* LoF can be drawn from any point of the Trooper's [[Silhouette]] to any point of the target's Silhouette without being obstructed by any pieces of scenery or the Silhouette of any Model (friendly or enemy).
To facilitate movement and interactions during game, we must consider the following exceptions when drawing LoF.

* As long as a Trooper can draw LoF to their target, the target can draw LoF to that Trooper as well, as long as that Trooper is within the target's front 180˚ arc.
* Troopers that declared any Skill with the [[Movement Label]] can draw a 360˚ LoF all along their route.
* Troopers do not obstruct LoF all along their route.
* Markers do not obstruct LoF.
* Unless specified otherwise, Markers have a 360˚ LoF.
* Troopers who are in [[Engaged State]] '''cannot''' draw LoF to Troopers or game elements that are not in Engaged State with them. In addition, Troopers who are in Engaged State are not affected by [[Visibility Conditions]] or by other rules affecting LoF.


{{see-also-start}}
'''[[Sixth Sense]]'''
* Allows the user to respond to Attacks (and only Attacks) directed at them by enemies outside their [[Line of Fire | LoF]]. For the purposes of drawing Line of Fire to the attackers, the user has a 360&deg; LoF arc, and if they are in [[Engaged State]], they can draw LoF to attackers outside their Close Combat.


'''[[360º Visor]]'''
* This type of Visor provides its user with a 360&#730; [[Line of Fire | LoF]] arc, rather than the usual 180&#730; arc.


'''[[Zero Visibility Zone]]'''
* [[Line of Fire | LoF]] cannot be drawn into, through, or out of a Zero Visibility Zone.


'''[[White Noise Zone]]'''
* A White Noise Zone acts as a Zero Visibility Zone, but only for Troopers with the [[Marksmanship]] Special Skill or equipped with a [[Multispectral Visor]] of any Level, or any other piece of Equipment that specifies the same.

{{greybox-start | LoF: Game Aids}}
Miniature poses and irregular scenery can make LoF hard to determine. In those cases, it is up to the players to reach an agreement. Trying to look at the target from the miniature’s point of view can be useful. To make checking LoF easier it is advised to make use of [[Silhouette Template]]s, rulers, laser pointers... to see whether anything obstructs the LoF.
