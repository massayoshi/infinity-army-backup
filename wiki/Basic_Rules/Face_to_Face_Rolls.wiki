When '''two or more Troopers''' act at the same time to try to thwart each other's progress, Face to Face Rolls are used to determine which side acts faster and more effectively.

To do so, both players roll for their Troopers involved in the face-off and '''compare each result to the relevant [[Success Value]]''', as they would in a [[Normal Roll]]. Failures are simply discarded but, unlike in a Normal Roll, each side's successes are compared to the opponent's.

When comparing, '''successes cancel enemy successes with a lower result''' even if they are canceled, in turn, by higher enemy successes.


{{important-start}}
For actions to be resolved with a Face to Face Roll, '''both Troopers' actions must affect each other directly'''. If either action does not affect the outcome of the other, use [[Normal Roll]]s instead.

'''Breaking Ties'''
<br>
Face to Face Rolls can result in a tie. In the event of a tie ([[Critical]]s or not), both rolls cancel each other, no effects are applied and the Order is spent.
{{important-end}}


{{greybox-start | Here is a rundown of possible outcomes}}
* '''Both fail'''. No one achieved their goal.
* '''One fails and the other passes'''. The Trooper that succeeded wins the Face to Face Roll and achieves its goal.
* '''Both pass'''. The Trooper with the higher successful roll cancels the enemy successes, wins the Face to Face Roll and achieves its goal.
* '''Both pass, but one rolls a [[Critical]]'''. The Trooper who got a Critical wins the Face to Face Roll, even if the Critical Roll was equal to or lower than the enemy success.
* '''Both roll Criticals'''. Neither Trooper wins the Face to Face Roll as the Criticals cancel each other and no effects are applied. Non-critical successes are discarded.
* '''One rolls a Critical and the other rolls two (or more) Criticals'''. As in the previous case, all Criticals are cancelled and no effects are applied.

=== Face to Face Roll: Dodge and Reset ===
In a Face to Face Roll, success in the Common Skills [[Dodge]] and [[Reset]] does not affect the ability of the attacker to execute their action, only their ability to affect the dodging/resetting Trooper. For example, dodging an Attack with several targets only cancels the attack against the Trooper who dodged, and does not cancel the attack against the rest of the targets.

In his Active Turn, the Fennec Fusilier (Trooper A) declares a [[BS Attack]] with his Combi Rifle against the Senku (Trooper B).

[[Range]] 15 inches

He will apply the following MODs to his BS Attack:
* +3 for [[Range]].
* -3 for [[Cover]].
His Success Value (SV) will be 12 + 3  3 = 12.

In her Reactive Turn, the Senku declares as an [[ARO]] a [[BS Attack]] with her Combi Rifle against the Fusilier.<br>
She will apply the following MODs to her BS Attack:
* +3 for [[Range]].
* -3 for [[Cover]].
Her Success Value (SV) will be 11 + 3  3 = 11.

All the Rolls are successful, but the Senku's 7 wins the Face to Face Roll because it cancels out all the other successful results below 7.

The Fennec Fusilier is hit, and he must make a [[Saving Roll]].

The Fennec declares a [[BS Attack]] with his full [[Burst]] against Senku A, who declares once again an [[ARO]] of BS Attack. Senku B declares an ARO of BS Attack against the Fennec.

Since the declared Attacks affect each other, the Fennec and Senku A must make a Face to Face Roll. Senku B will make a [[Normal Roll]] because the Fennec's shots do not affect him.
* Range 15 inches
* Range 9 inches

The Fennec will apply the following MODs to his BS Attack
* +3 for [[Range]].
* -3 for [[Cover]].

His Success Value (SV) will be 12 + 3  3 = 12.

Both Senku will apply the following MODs to their BS Attacks:
* +3 for [[Range]].
* -3 for [[Cover]].

Their Success Value (SV) will be 11 + 3  3 = 11.

In the Face to Face Roll both get a [[Critical]], and as a result, their successes cancel each other and none of them hits their target.

Meanwhile, Senku B gets a 14 in his Roll, and, since his Success Value (SV) was 11, he misses his shot against the Fennec.

If the Fennec divided his Combi Rifle's [[Burst]] (B) 3, making 2 shots against Senku A and 1 against Senku B, we would have to make two Face to Face Rolls.

The Fennec will apply the following MODs to his BS Attack:
* +3 for [[Range]].
* -3 for [[Cover]].

His Success Value (SV) will be 12 + 3  3 = 12

Both Senku will apply the following MODs to their BS Attacks:
* +3 for [[Range]].
* -3 for [[Cover]].

Their Success Value (SV) will be 11 + 3  3 = 11.

In the first Face to Face Roll, Fennec VS Senku A, the 5 cancels out the Fusilier's 4 and the 9 wins the Face to Face Roll since it is the highest success. Therefore, Senku A is successfully hit, and she will have to make a [[Saving Roll | Save Roll]].

In the second Face to Face Roll, Fennec VS Senku B, both get an 11, which is a success for both. However, for Senku B this is a [[Critical]] and, as a result, he wins the Face to Face Roll. Now it is the Fennec who has been successfully hit, and it is a Critical Hit!
