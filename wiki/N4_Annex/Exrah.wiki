{{effects}}
* If the Trooper enters [[Unconscious]] State, they automatically pass directly to [[Dead]] State, without suffering the loss of an extra Wounds/STR point, and are removed from play.
* Therefore, the Trooper cannot be healed (by Special Skills or Equipment such as [[Doctor]], [[MediKit]], [[Regeneration]]...).
* This Special Skill remains active even when its owner is in a [[Null]] state.
