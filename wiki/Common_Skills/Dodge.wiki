{{n5-section-common-skills}}


This Common Skill allows the user to move and to attempt to evade an Attack against them. It also gives the user the opportunity to turn around to face an enemy who acts outside their LoF.

{{skill-label | Movement }}
{{requirements}}
Troopers can only Dodge if at least one of these is true:
* They are the Active Trooper.
* In the Reactive Turn, if they are allowed to declare an [[ARO]].
{{effects}}
* Allows the user to make a [[Face to Face Roll]] to evade all enemy Attacks during an Order or ARO, regardless of the [[Burst]] (B) value (for example, Dodging every strike in [[Close Combat]], or shots from several opponents).
* This Face to Face Roll pits the user's PH Attribute against whichever Attribute the attacker uses (BS, CC, PH or WIP).
* If the user is not making a Face to Face Roll (for example if they have not been Attacked or have been affected by a [[Direct Template Weapon]]), they will instead make a [[Normal]] PH Roll.
* Dodge does not allow the user to evade [[Comms Attacks]], but the [[Reset]] Common Skill does.
* A successful Normal or Face to Face Dodge Roll allows the user to move up to 2 inches. This movement:
** Is measured, declared, and the Trooper moves, during the [[Effects step]] of the Order Expenditure Sequence. If both players have Troopers that successfully Dodged, the Active Player will move their Troopers first, then the Reactive Player will move theirs.
** Does not generate [[ARO]]s or trigger [[Deployable Weapon]]s or Equipment.
* Dodge follows the [[General Movement Rules]] as well as the [[Moving and Measuring]] sidebar, both of which are explained in the [[Movement Module]].
* Dodge allows the user to enter [[Engaged State]] with an enemy, as long as the movement is enough to reach [[Silhouette contact]] with that enemy.
* A successful Dodge Roll, whether it is a Normal or Face to Face, allows the user to cancel their Engaged State and [[Immobilized-A State | IMM-A State]], applying any State-specific MODs.
{{css_skillbox-end}}


{{important-start}}
A -3 PH MOD must be applied to the Dodge Roll in the following circumstances. Even if several of these circumstances apply, only one -3 MOD is applied.
* In [[ARO]], if the Active Trooper is inside [[ZoC]] and outside [[LoF]].
* If Dodging a [[Template Weapon]] without LoF to the attacker.
* If Dodging the Template of a [[Deployable Weapon]].

==Examples==
{{greybox-start | Example of Dodge and Engaged}}
'''Step 1:'''

The Active Trooper declares [[Move]] as the first Basic Short Skill of their Order.

The enemy declares Dodge as their [[ARO]], attempting to reach close combat, to halt the Active Trooper's advance.

The Active Trooper declares [[BS Attack]] as the second Skill of their Order. The {{erratahighlight}}Active Trooper's{{erratahighlight-end}} Success Value will be 15 (12 + 3):
* BS = 12.
* +3 for Range.

The Reactive Trooper's Success Value will be 10:
* PH = 10

'''Step 2:'''

The corresponding [[Face to Face Roll]] is performed.

The Reactive Trooper wins the Face to Face Roll and dodges the Active Trooper's shots. If the player chooses to, they may now move the Reactive Trooper up to 2 inches in any direction.

'''Step 3:'''

During step 5.1 of the [[Order Expenditure Sequence]], the Reactive Trooper checks how far he can get with his 2 inches of movement. After checking that the Active Trooper is within that distance, he decides to move into contact, and ends up in [[Engaged State]].

{{greybox-start | Example of Dodge and a Deployable Weapon}}
During his Active Turn, the Trooper declares [[Move]] as the first Basic Short Skill of their Order.

The Reactive Trooper is probably within a [[Mines | Mine]]'s Trigger Area. If he declares an [[ARO]], the Mine will detonate. Since the alternative to not declaring an ARO is to suffer three unopposed shots from the enemy, the Reactive Trooper declares Dodge as their ARO. The Active Trooper declares [[BS Attack]] as the second Skill of their Order.

Declaring the Dodge ARO gives the Reactive Trooper a [[Face to Face Roll]] against the 3 enemy shots, and also an attempt to avoid being hit by the Mine.

The Reactive Trooper's Success Value will be 10:
* PH = 10

The Active Trooper's Success Value will be 15:
* BS = 12
* +3 for Range

Result:

The Reactive Trooper manages to avoid the {{erratahighlight}}Active Trooper's{{erratahighlight-end}} shots by winning the Face to Face Roll with his 8.

However, the Mine hits the Reactive Trooper. The Mine is a [[Deployable Weapon]], and it imposes a -3 MOD to Dodge. Therefore, the Reactive Trooper would only avoid the mine if his die's result was 7 or less. By failing to Dodge the Mine's impact, the Reactive Trooper will also be unable to move up to 2 inches, even though he succeeded against the Active Trooper's Attacks.
