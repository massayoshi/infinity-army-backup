This Common Skill allows the user to scale heights and move up and down vertical surfaces.

{{skillbox |red| CLIMB | ENTIRE ORDER}}
{{skill-label | Movement, No LoF, No Roll.}}
{{Requirements}}
Players will check the Requirements of this Skill when declaring it.
* The user's base must be in contact with a vertical surface.  
* The Trooper’s base must always be in contact with the surface on which they intend to move. Any surface they move on must be at least half as wide as their base.  {{seefaq  | You must use the full width if available.}}
* At the end of their movement, the Trooper must be able to place themself on a surface that is equal or larger than their base.
{{Effects}}
* The user may climb vertically up to the first value of his ''[[MOV]]'' Attribute in inches, measuring from the base’s outer edge and underside. {{seefaq}}
* Climbing does not require a Roll.
* For visualization purposes, Troopers using the Climb Skill move with at least half of their base’s underside in contact with the vertical surface.
{{update | 1.1.1, Dec 2021}}
* Climbing only allows moving on vertical surfaces{{erratahighlight}}. Therefore, the Troop will end its Climbing movement the moment the whole of its base is in contact with a horizontal surface (see example).
{{update-end}}
{{original}}
* Climb only allows movement on vertical surfaces{{originalhighlight}}; this means Troopers cannot use their excess Climbing movement to keep moving on a horizontal surface once they are done climbing. Once the Trooper reaches a level surface, his movement ends for that Order, placing the Trooper on the horizontal surface (see diagram). 
{{original-end}}
* Climbing movement must follow the ''[[General Movement Rules]]'' as well as the ''[[Moving and Measuring]]'' rules.


{{important-start}}
* Troopers cannot be deployed on a vertical surface, neither during the Deployment Phase nor during the game. 
* As long as the user is holding on to a vertical surface, he cannot declare any Skills other than Climb.
* Troopers who are Climbing or holding on to a vertical surface cannot benefit from ''[[Partial Cover]] '''[[MODs]]'''''.
* A Trooper that is on a vertical surface and becomes ''[[Unconscious]]'' will place the corresponding Marker beside them as usual. Even while climbing, ''[[Unconscious]]'' Troopers are still in ''[[Prone]]'' state, except for those Unit Types that cannot enter Prone state.
{{important-end}}


{{remember-start}}
A Trooper in the ''[[Reactive Turn]]'' who is holding onto a vertical surface cannot ARO. The reason for this is that, while on a vertical surface, the only available Skill is ''[[Climb]]'', and ''[[Climb]]'' is an Entire Order that cannot be used in the ''[[Reactive Turn]]''.
{{remember-end}}


{{remember-start}}
Any height on the game table that is higher than the height of a Trooper’s ''[[Silhouette Template]]''—determined by the Trooper’s Silhouette Attribute—requires declaring the ''[[Jump]]'' or ''[[Climb]]'' Common Skills to pass it.

== Examples ==
{{greybox-start | Example 1}}
{{image | name=eng-climb-1.jpg | style=512border }}

{{update | 1.1.1, Dec 2021}}
A Trooper that is in contact with an obstacle declares the Climb Skill. {{erratahighlight}}When measuring, the first MOV value of the Trooper (4 inches) is enough to climb the 3 inch tall obstacle and move onto the upper surface.
{{update-end}}
{{original}}
A Trooper that is in contact with an obstacle declares the Climb Skill. {{originalhighlight}}The obstacle is measured and is 4 inches tall, the same as the Trooper’s first MOV Attribute value, therefore they climb up and are placed on the upper surface.
{{original-end}}
{{greybox-end}}


{{greybox-start | Example 2}}
{{image | name=eng-climb-2-1024.jpg | style=512border }}

{{update | 1.1.1, Dec 2021}}
A Trooper uses one Order to declare the Move Skill until {{erratahighlight}}they reach contact with an obstacle. With a second Order, they declare the Climb Skill, and check that the 4 inches are enough to move fully on to the top part, with the Trooper ending their movement on the horizontal surface.{{erratahighlight-end}} Next, the player declares a third Order to reach the edge of the obstacle.
{{update-end}}

A Trooper uses one Order to declare the Move Skill until {{originalhighlight}}being in contact with an obstacle. With a second Order, they declare the Climb Skill, checks that the 4 inches are enough to reach the top part, placing the Trooper on the horizontal surface.{{originalhighlight-end}} Next, the player declares a third Order to reach the edge of the obstacle.
{{original-end}}

Since they see no enemies and there is no ARO, their Order’s second Skill will be an Idle. By consuming a fourth Order, the player declares Climb and descends 4 inches. Finally, with a fifth Order, the Trooper finishes their movement on the other side, on the obstacle’s base.

Remember that a Trooper will end their Climb movement the moment they reach a horizontal surface.

If at some point the player had decided not to consume more Orders for said Trooper, they would have remained in the horizontal or vertical position in which they were until they consume more Orders, or they end up Dead.

q = Q: While using Move or Climb, can you move 'through' a corner {{erratahighlight}}or overhang the edge of the surface{{erratahighlight-end}}, in the same way that you can move through a space that's half the width of the Trooper's base? |
a = A: No. If the space is wide enough for the Trooper's full base, you must use the full base.

q = Q: How are Jump and Climb movement measured? |
a = A: When measuring Jump or Climb movement, you can measure from any point of the Trooper's Silhouette at the start of the movement, but you must measure to the base's outer edge and underside at the end of the movement. The Trooper can vault over obstacles (parapets etc.) that are equal to or lower than the height of their Silhouette as normal.

{{image | name=faq_jump_climb_measurement_v01.png | style=512border }}

''Development team note: By gaining distance from the Silhouette and allowing the Trooper to ignore parapets (as long as they are equal to or lower than the Silhouette height), movement while Jumping or Climbing is facilitated. This makes these movements easier and gives extra value to Troopers with Super-Jump and Climbing Plus. As we can see in the image, the Jump path is the same even without the parapet.'' |
