*A Trooper that declares Idle performs no action. As such, its declaration just activates the Trooper, potentially generating AROs.
*Whenever a Trooper that received an Order in the ''[[Active Turn]]'' chooses not to perform an action with one of the two Short Skills of that Order, that Trooper is considered to declare Idle.
*In the Resolution Step of the Order, if a Trooper is found to have '''not met the Requirements '''of a declared Skill, they instead perform an Idle. In this situation:
**The ammunition of ''[[Disposable]]'' weapons or pieces of Equipment is spent.
**If the Trooper is in Marker form, it is revealed, and its Model is placed where the Marker was.
