Basic Common Skill that allows Troopers to move about the battlefield.

{{css_skillbox |blue| MOVE | BASIC SHORT SKILL}}
{{skill-label | Movement, No LoF, No Roll.}}
{{Requirements}}
Players must check the Requirements of this Skill when declaring it.
* At least half the Trooper's base must stay in contact with the surface on which they are moving, except when vaulting over obstacles (see [[General Movement Rules]]).
* Any surface they move on must be at least half as wide as their base.
* The Trooper must be able to finish their movement on a surface that's equal to or larger than their base.

{{Effects}}
* Allows the user to traverse the battlefield up to a distance determined by his [[MOV]] [[Attribute]].
* By declaring Move, the user may move up to the first value of his MOV Attribute in inches.
* If the user declares Move again as their second Basic Short Skill of the Order, they may then move up to the second value of their MOV Attribute in inches.
* Move must follow the [[General Movement Rules]] as well as the [[Moving and Measuring]] rules.

== Examples ==
{{greybox-start | Moving over catwalks and through narrow passageways. }}

{{greybox-end}}


{{greybox-start | Order (Move + Move) on surfaces that are smaller than the base}}
{{image | name=n5/eng-move-example-3.jpg | style=full }}

Although in both cases the distance covered is 8 inches, in case B, it is not possible to carry out the movement because there is no valid surface at the end of the first Move.
