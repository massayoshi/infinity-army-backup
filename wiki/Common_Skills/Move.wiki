Common Skill that allows the user to move about the battlefield.

{{skillbox |blue| MOVE | SHORT MOVEMENT SKILL}}
{{skill-label | Movement, No LoF, No Roll.}}
{{Requirements}}
* Players will check the Requirements of this Skill when declaring it.
** The Trooper’s base must always be in contact with the surface on which they intend to move. 
** Any surface they move on must be at least half as wide as their base. {{seefaq | You must use the full width if available.}}
** The Trooper must be able to finish their movement on a surface that’s equal to or larger than their base. 
{{Effects}}
* Allows the user to traverse the battlefield up to a distance determined by his [[MOV]] Attribute.
* By declaring Move, the user may move up to the first value of his [[MOV]] Attribute in inches. 
* If the user declares Move again in the same Order, he may then move up to the second value of his [[MOV]] Attribute in inches. 
* Move must follow the [[General Movement Rules]] as well as the ''[[Moving and Measuring]] rules''.

{{greybox-start | Move over catwalks and narrow corridors }}

{{greybox-end}}


{{greybox-start | Order (Move + Move) on surfaces that are smaller than the base}}
{{image | name=eng-move-smaller-than-base.jpg | style= fullborder }}

Although in both cases the Distance covered is 8 inches, in case B, it is not possible to carry out the movement because there is no valid surface at the end of the first Movement value.

q = Q: While using Move or Climb, can you move 'through' a corner {{erratahighlight}}or overhang the edge of the surface{{erratahighlight-end}}, in the same way that you can move through a space that's half the width of the Trooper's base? |
a = A: No. If the space is wide enough for the Trooper's full base, you must use the full base.
