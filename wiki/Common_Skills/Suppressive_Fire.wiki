Suppressive Fire is a combat stance that gives the user the ability to deter enemy actions and movements through concentrated fire.

While in Suppressive Fire, the soldier is more concerned with saturating the combat area with gunfire than he is with actually inflicting damage to the enemy forces. The goal of Suppressive Fire is to restrict the capacity of the enemy forces to maneuver or return fire successfully, by threatening them with indiscriminate hostile fire.
