This Skill allows the user to locate enemies hidden in the form of a Marker, forcing them to reveal the Trooper, Weapon, or Equipment that the Marker represents.

{{skillbox |blueyellow| DISCOVER | SHORT MOVEMENT SKILL / ARO}}
{{Requirements}}
*The user must be able to draw LoF to the target. 
*This Skill cannot be used against the same Target twice in the same Order. 
{{Effects}}
*If the user passes a Normal [[WIP]] Roll, applying the same MODs as in a [[BS Attack]] ([[Cover]], [[Range]], [[Mimetism]]...), the target Marker is removed, and must be replaced with the actual Trooper Model, or Weapon or Equipment Token.
*A Trooper that fails a [[WIP]] Roll to Discover a [[Marker]] cannot attempt to Discover the same Marker until the next [[Player Turn]]. <br> The Trooper may still attempt to Discover a different Marker that [[Player Turn]], and its player may still attempt to Discover the first Marker using a different Trooper. <br> 
{{c1}}
: Note that a Trooper that has been revealed, and re-entered [[Camouflaged]] State again, does not count as the same Marker.
{{c1end}}{{n4list}}
: Note that a Trooper that has been revealed, and re-entered [[Camouflaged]] or [[Impersonation State|Impersonation]]-1 or 2 State again, does not count as the same Marker. 
{{n4end}}
*A Trooper that fails the [[WIP]] Roll attempting to [[Discover]] a [[Marker]], may attempt to Discover '''another '''different [[Marker]]. 
*The Discover Skill has its own [[Range]] [[MODs]], as if it were a [[BS Weapon]].

{{remember-start}}
Discover is a Short Movement Skill, and it may therefore be combined with any other Short Skill or Short Movement Skill. (See [[Trooper Activation]].)
{{remember-end}}


{{important-start}}
A common combination in an Order is '''[[Discover]] + [[Attack]]'''. This tactical maneuver allows you to declare an Attack against a Camouflaged enemy, which cannot normally be done. 
* If the Camouflaged target declares an ARO, revealing themselves, there is no need to perform the [[Discover]] Roll before resolving the [[Attack]].
* If the Camouflaged target does not declare an ARO, the Trooper will need to pass the [[Discover]] Roll before resolving any [[Attack]] against that target.
* Remember that the Active Trooper may [[Discover]] one target and [[Attack]] a different target if they so choose.
