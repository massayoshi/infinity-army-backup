This Skill allows the user to locate enemies hidden in the form of a Marker, forcing them to reveal the Trooper, Weapon, or Equipment that the Marker represents

{{css_skillbox |blueyellow| DISCOVER | BASIC SHORT SKILL / ARO }}
 {{requirements}}
* The user must be able to draw [[LoF]] to the target.
* This Skill cannot be used against the same Target twice in the same Order.
{{effects}}
* If the user passes a Normal [[WIP]] Roll, applying the same MODs as in a [[BS Attack]] ([[Cover]], [[Range]], [[Mimetism]]...), the target Marker is removed, and must be replaced with the actual Trooper Model, or Weapon or Equipment Token.
* A Trooper that fails a WIP Roll to Discover a Marker cannot attempt to Discover the same Marker until the next Player Turn.
* The Trooper may still attempt to Discover a different Marker that Player Turn, and its player may still attempt to Discover the first Marker using a different Trooper.
* Note that a Trooper that has been revealed, and re-entered [[Camouflaged State]] or [[Impersonation State | Impersonation-1 or 2 State]] again, does not count as the same Marker.
* A Trooper that fails the WIP Roll attempting to Discover a Marker, may attempt to Discover another different Marker.
* The Discover Skill has its own Range MODs, as if it were a BS Weapon

{{remember-start}}
Discover is a Basic Short Skill, and it may therefore be combined with any other Basic Short Skill or Short Skill (see [[Trooper Activation]]).
{{remember-end}}


{{important-start}}
A common combination in an Order is Discover + Attack. This tactical maneuver allows you to declare an Attack against a Camouflaged enemy, which cannot normally be done.
* If the Camouflaged target declares an ARO, revealing themselves, there is no need to perform the Discover Roll before resolving the Attack.
* If the Camouflaged target does not declare an ARO, the Trooper will need to pass the Discover Roll before resolving any Attack against that target.
* Remember that the Active Trooper may Discover one target and Attack a different target if they choose to do so.
