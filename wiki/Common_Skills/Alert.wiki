Troopers are aware of what is happening around them and are also connected to their comrades, so attacks do not go unnoticed.

{{skill-label | Optional, No Roll.}}
{{Requirements}}
* The Trooper '''CANNOT '''have been activated by an [[Order]] or ARO in the same Order.
* The Trooper, or an Allied Trooper within their Zone of Control, has been the target of an Attack.
{{Effects}}
* At the end of the Order, during its Conclusion, and after performing any [[Saving Rolls]], Troopers that meet the Requirements may turn on the spot, without changing position, to modify their LoF angle as their player chooses.  
* This movement is automatic, it does not require a Roll and does not generate AROs, since it happens during the Conclusion Step of the Order.
