'''Troopers can only Reset if at least one of these is true:'''

*{{originalhighlight}}In the [[Reactive Turn]], they have a valid ARO, or are targeted by a [[Hacking Program]] or other [[Comms Attack]]. {{seefaq}}

{{effects}}
*Allows the user to make a Face to Face Roll to evade all enemy [[Hacking Programs]] or other [[Comms Attacks]] during an Order or ARO, regardless of the [[Burst]] (B) value.
*This Face to Face Roll pits the user's [[WIP]] Attribute against the attacker's [[WIP]] Attribute.
*If the user is not making a Face to Face Roll (for example they are not the target of a [[Hacking Program]] or other [[Comms Attack]]), they will instead make a Normal Roll against their [[WIP]] Attribute.
*Reset does not allow the user to evade other types of Attacks, but the [[Dodge]] Skill does.
*A successful [[Reset]] Roll, whether it's a Normal or Face to Face, allows the user to cancel their [[Targeted]] State and [[IMM-B]] State, applying any State-specific [[MODs]]. {{seefaq | State MODs are cumulative.}}


{{remember-start}}
A Reset only allows Face to Face Rolls against [[Hacking Attacks]] and other [[Comms Attacks]].
