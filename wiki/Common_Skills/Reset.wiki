{{skill-label | No LoF }}
{{requirements}}
Troopers can only Reset if at least one of these is true:
* They are the Active Trooper.
* In the Reactive Turn, if they are allowed to declare an [[ARO]].
{{effects}}
* Allows the user to make a [[Face to Face Roll]] to evade all enemy [[Comms Attacks]] and [[BS Attack#BS Attack (Guided) | BS Attacks (Guided)]] during an [[Order]] or [[ARO]], regardless of the [[Burst]] (B) value.
* This Face to Face Roll pits the user's [[WIP]] Attribute against the attacker's WIP Attribute.
* If the user is not making a Face to Face Roll (for example they are not the target of a Comms Attack), they will instead make a [[Normal Roll]] against their WIP Attribute.
* Reset does not allow the user to evade other types of Attacks, but the [[Dodge]] Skill does.
* A successful Reset Roll, whether it's a Normal or Face to Face, allows the user to cancel their [[Targeted State]] and [[IMM-B]] State, applying any State-specific MODs.
