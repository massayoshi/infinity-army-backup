Under certain circumstances, Troopers can declare this Common Skill to move about the battlefield without attracting enemy AROs.

{{css_skillbox |red| CAUTIOUS MOVEMENT | LONG SKILL}}
{{skill-label | Movement, No Roll.}}
{{Effects}}
* Allows the Trooper to move up to the first value of his [[MOV]] [[Attribute]], generating no enemy [[ARO]]s in the process.
* '''Restriction.''' For this Cautious Movement to generate no [[ARO]]s, it must begin and end at two points on the game table that lie outside the [[LoF]] and [[ZoC]] of all enemy Models and Markers.
* If the Cautious Movement begins or ends within the LoF or ZoC of any enemy Trooper (in Model form) or Marker, the Trooper generates AROs as usual.
* '''Restriction. '''For the Cautious Movement of a '''[[Hackable]] Trooper in [[Model]] form''' to generate no AROs, it must also begin and end at two points on the game table that lie outside the [[Hacking Area]] of any [[enemy]] [[Hacker]]s.
* If a '''Hackable Trooper is in Model form''' and its Cautious Movement begins or ends inside the Hacking Area of any enemy Hackers, the Trooper generates AROs as usual. <br>If a '''non'''-Hackable Trooper is in Model form and its Cautious Movement begins or ends inside the Hacking Area of any enemy Hackers, this does '''not''' cause the Trooper to generate AROs.
* Cautious Movement must follow the [[General Movement Rules]] as well as the [[Moving and Measuring]] rules.

{{important-start}}
This Common Skill cannot be declared by [[Unit_Profile#Trooper_Characteristics | TAGs, Remotes, Vehicles]], Troopers with [[Motorcycle]]s, Troopers with the [[Aerial]] Special Skill, or Troopers in [[Targeted State]].
{{important-end}}


{{remember-start}}
Troopers in [[Hidden Deployment]] are neither Models nor Markers, so they cannot react to a Cautious Movement by having [[LoF]] or being in [[ZoC]].
{{remember-end}}


{{see-also}}
'''[[Stealth]]'''
* If the user declares [[Cautious Movement]], [[Idle]], or a Basic Short Skill with the [[Movement Label]], they only grant [[ARO]]s to enemies that have [[LoF]] to them.

{{greybox-start | Cautious Movement Example }}
A PanOceanian Trooper in Model form intends to close in on a Nomad Trooper. Since the Trooper is in [[Total Cover]] behind a tall building, outside the [[LoF]] and [[ZoC]] of the Nomad Troopers and an enemy [[Camouflaged | Camouflage Marker]], the PanOceanian Trooper uses part of their first [[MOV]] value to move behind a container where they will also be outside the LoF and ZoC of the Nomad Troopers and the Camouflage Marker.

No Nomad Troopers, including the Camouflage Marker, can declare [[ARO]]s, since the PanOceanian Trooper's Movement begins and ends outside their LoF and ZoC.
