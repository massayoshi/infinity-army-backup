* '''Attack MOD''': A MOD to the CC Attribute of the user when making a CC Attack.
* '''Opponent MOD''': A MOD applied to the Attribute of an enemy when making a Face to Face Roll.
* '''Burst MOD''': A MOD to the Burst (B) value of the user's CC Weapon when making a CC Attack. <br> The "+1 SD" MOD allows the player to roll one extra die, and then select and discard one die from the Roll. This extra die does not increase the Burst value of the CC Weapon and does not expend additional Disposable uses. If distributing Burst between several targets, the extra die must be allocated to one of those targets, and a die discarded from the Roll against that target. <br> If used in a Face to Face roll, a die is selected and discarded after both players have rolled. If both players have to select and discard a die, the Active Player selects first. <br> This MOD applies in both Active and Reactive Turns.

{{important-start}}
The MODs in the Martial Arts Chart are applied in both the [[Active Turn]] and the [[Reactive Turn]].
{{important-end}}


{{advice}}
If a Trooper has B1 and (+1SD), this MOD does not increase the [[Burst]] value and the extra die cannot be allocated to a different Trooper. However, if he has (+1 SD) and the Burst value is higher than one and he distributes the Burst between several targets, the extra die must be allocated to one of those targets, and a die discarded from the Roll against that target.

== Examples ==
{{greybox-start | Example 1. Martial Arts L3 vs Martial Arts L1}}
During his Active Turn, a Trooper with the Martial Arts L3 Special Skill declares a [[CC Attack]] against a Trooper with the Martial Arts L1 Special Skill. Applying the values that correspond to each level, the MODs are calculated:

'''Active Trooper:'''<br>
The Trooper must apply the following MODs:
* +3 for Martial Arts L3.
* -3 for the Reactive Trooper's Martial Arts L1.

The Active Trooper's Success Value is calculated:
* SV = 23 (23 +3 - 3).

The Active Trooper has a [[Modifiers Explained | (+1 SD) MOD]] to their [[Burst]], so they roll two dice for the [[Face to Face Roll]] and discard one of them.

'''Reactive Trooper:'''<br>
The Trooper must apply the following MODs:
* -3 for the Active Trooper's Martial Arts L3.

The Reactive Trooper's Success Value is calculated:
* SV = 18 (21 - 3).

The Reactive Trooper rolls a single die as he does not have any MOD to his Burst.

{{greybox-start | Example 2. Martial Arts L4 vs Doctor + Peripheral (Servant)}}
{{image | name=n5/eng-martial-arts-example-1.jpg | style=fullborder }}

In his Active Turn, a Trooper with the Martial Arts L4 Special Skill declares a [[CC Attack]] against a [[Doctor]] and his [[Peripheral]] (Servant).

The Reactive Player declares CC Attack, choosing the Doctor to make the CC Attack. The Doctor will receive +1[[B]] in CC since his Peripheral is in the combat.

Both Players apply their different MODs:

'''Active Trooper:'''
* +3 to CC for Martial Arts L4.

The Trooper's Success Value is calculated:
* SV = 26 (23 + 3).

The Active Trooper has a +1B MOD to their Burst, so they roll two dice for the [[Face to Face Roll]].

'''Doctor:'''
* -3 to CC due to the Active Trooper's Martial Arts L4.
* +1B due to the [[Close Combat with Multiple Troopers]] rule.

The Doctor's Success Value is calculated:
* SV = 12 (15 - 3).

The Doctor only rolls two dice.

The Active Trooper performs a CC Face to Face Roll with two dice against the Doctor's two dice in ARO.

The Active Trooper is in an advantageous position. Analyzing the possible outcomes of the Face to Face Roll reveals the following:

{{image | name=n5/eng-martial-arts-example-2.jpg | style=full }}

Unless the Doctor gets a Critical hit, the Active Trooper will win the Face to Face Roll if he rolls a 13 or higher. In addition, any of the dice that roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 would be Critical hits.

The Doctor's CC has gone down from 15 to 12. Even though he rolls two dice, his chances of winning the Face to Face Roll are slim.

'''[[Rolls#Attributes_and_Success_Value_Above_20 | Success Values above 20]]''' increase the number of results on the die roll that give a [[Critical]] hit.
