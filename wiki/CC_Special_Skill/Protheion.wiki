{{css_skillbox |black| PROTHEION | AUTOMATIC SKILL }}
{{skill-label | CC Special Skill, Optional. }}
{{requirements}}
* In the Active or Reactive Turn, the Trooper must reach or be in [[Silhouette contact]] with the target and declare a [[CC Attack]].
* The target must have the [[VITA]] Attribute.
{{effects}}
* For each [[Wound]] they inflict on the target of the CC Attack, or [[CC Attack#Coup de Gr&acirc;ce | Coup de Gr&acirc;ce]] they perform, the user removes 1 Wound they have received. If the user hasn't received any Wounds, they increase their VITA Attribute value by 1.
* '''Restriction:''' The value of the user's VITA Attribute may only be increased by a maximum of '''two points'''.
* If the user's VITA Attribute is higher than its original value, the player must place a Power-Up 1 or Power-Up 2 Token to indicate the current value of the Trooper's VITA Attribute.
* When multiple Wounds are inflicted in the same Order, the user follows this sequence:
** First, they use Wounds they have inflicted to remove their Wounds, if they have any.
** Then they use any remaining Wounds they have inflicted to increase the value of their VITA Attribute, never increasing it beyond the maximum of two points.
** Finally, any Wounds inflicted on them during this Order are applied.

== Examples ==
{{greybox-start | Example 1}}
A Trooper with the Protheion Special Skill enters [[Close Combat]] against an enemy, who declares [[CC Attack]] as their [[ARO]]. The Trooper with Protheion wins the fight and the enemy fails their [[Saving Roll]], receiving a [[Wound]] and entering [[Unconscious State]]. When the Order concludes, the Trooper with Protheion places a Power-Up 1 Token next to his base, showing that his [[VITA]] Attribute is now 2.

During the next Order, the Trooper with the Protheion Special Skill declares a CC Attack against the Unconscious enemy, performing a [[CC Attack#Coup de Gr&acirc;ce | Coup de Gr&acirc;ce]] so that the target automatically passes from Unconscious to [[Dead State]], without performing a Saving Roll. At the end of the Order, the Trooper with Protheion places a Power-Up 2 Token next to his base, showing that his VITA Attribute is now 3.

{{greybox-start | Example 2}}
A Trooper with the Protheion Special Skill and a [[VITA]] Attribute of 2, who has received a [[Wound]] in a previous combat, uses his [[DA]] CC Weapon to [[CC Attack]] an enemy who has a VITA Attribute of 2. The Trooper with Protheion wins the Roll, forcing the enemy to perform 2 [[Saving Roll]]s due to his DA CC Weapon. The enemy fails both Saving Rolls, receives 2 Wounds, and enters [[Unconscious State]]. Thanks to his Protheion Special Skill, the Trooper removes the Wound he had previously received, and increases the value of his VITA Attribute by one, placing a Power-Up 1 Token next to his base. If, in a later Order, he performs a [[CC Attack#Coup de Gr&acirc;ce | Coup de Gr&acirc;ce]] against the Unconscious enemy, he increases his VITA Attribute by another point and replaces the Power-Up 1 Token with a Power-Up 2 Token. The Trooper with Protheion now has a VITA Attribute value of 4 and the enemy is removed from the game table.

Letâ€™s say that the Trooper had not received any Wounds and still inflicts two Wounds on his enemy. And, during the same Order, a different enemy opens fire on him from a distance and inflicts one Wound. In this case, the Trooper first increases his VITA value by two by inflicting two Wounds on the enemy in Close Combat, and then he receives the Wound caused by the enemy shooter. At the end of the Order, he has a VITA Attribute value of 4 represented by a Power-Up 2 Token, and one Wound.
