{{effects}}
* The White Noise Hacking Program generates a [[White Noise Zone]] the size of a Circular Template and with infinite height.
* On a successful Normal WIP Roll, the Hacker may place the Circular Template representing the White Noise Zone inside their [[Hacking Area]] at the end of the Order. {{seefaq | The position must be chosen when declaring White Noise.}}
* The Circular Template must be totally inside the Hacking Area.
* The effects of this Program persist until the start of the [[States Phase]], at which point you must remove the Circular Template.
* The range of this Program is the Hacker's [[Hacking Area]].
{{update | PDF 2.1, July 2023}}
* {{erratahighlight}}While the Circular Template is on the game table, the Program’s NFB Label applies to the Hacker, so they cannot use or apply any other Skill, piece of Equipment, or Hacking Program that has the NFB Label, for example [[Mimetism]], [[Albedo]], [[Holoprojector]] etc.{{erratahighlight-end}}

q = Q: Do you need to specify all details of a Skill when declaring it? For example where the target is for a BS Attack, or where the template is being placed for White Noise? |
a = A: Yes, with the exception of the target’s position, which is chosen in the Resolution step, before measuring Ranges. If the order of declaration is important, the active player chooses who declares first. |
