This term refers to the Area of Effect of Hacking Programs. In Infinity N4 a Hacker’s Hacking Area matches their [[Zone of Control]], and the Zone of Control of [[Repeater]]s and [[Deployable Repeater]]s of either the Player or their Allies.

In addition, if a Hacker is within the Zone of Control of an Enemy Repeater or Deployable Repeater, their Hacking Area includes all Enemy Hackers on the game table.

==Hacking Area and AROs==
Enemies entering or acting inside the Hacking Area of a Hacker while remaining outside that Hacker’s [[LoF]] and ZoC can be reacted to with Hacking Programs or with Reset.

Players can check the Hacking Area. Measurements must always be made from the [[Active Trooper]] and their Repeaters, checking a maximum of 8 inches from any point along their path. If the Active Trooper is within the Hacking Area of the Reactive Trooper, they can declare an ARO (See [[Order Expenditure Sequence]]).

The Hacker may use their Hacking Programs in the area that includes the Zone of Control of the Repeater, the Deployable Repeater and their own Zone of Control.

{{erratahighlight}}In this example, [[Stealth]] is not being used.{{erratahighlight-end}}

During his Active Turn, the Shrouded Hacker decides to declare Idle as the first Short Skill of the Order. As shown in the picture, he is outside his enemies LoF {{erratahighlight}}and ZoC{{erratahighlight-end}}, but since he is a Hacker, he can use the Deployable Repeater, and the M-Drone Trooper (who carries the Repeater piece of Equipment), to increase his Hacking Area, allowing him to act from his current position.

{{erratahighlight}}As the Shrouded Hacker is inside the Orc Hacker’s Hacking Area, the Orc Hacker declares an ARO.{{erratahighlight-end}}

{{erratahighlight}}The Orc Hacker declares Oblivion.{{erratahighlight-end}}

The second Skill of the Shrouded Hacker is Carbonite, dividing his B2 between the Knight of Justice and the Orc Hacker.

{{erratahighlight}}The Knight of Justice has now been targeted by a Hacking Program, given she an ARO, and she declare Reset.{{erratahighlight-end}}

{{originalhighlight}}Therefore, since both the Knight of Justice and the Orc Trooper Hacker are clearly within the Hacking Area of the Shrouded Hacker, they each declare their AROs.{{originalhighlight-end}}

{{originalhighlight}}The Knight of Justice declares Reset as their ARO and the Orc Hacker declares Oblivion.{{originalhighlight-end}}

The second Skill of the Shrouded Hacker is Carbonite, dividing his B2 between the Knight of Justice and the Orc Hacker. 

{{originalhighlight}}During the Resolution of the Order, it is verified that both the Knight of Justice and the Orc Hacker are within the Hacking Area of the Shrouded Hacker.{{originalhighlight-end}}
{{original-end}}

The following Face to Face Rolls occur:
*Reset by the Knight of Justice vs Carbonite from the Shrouded.
** No Modifiers (MOD).
*Oblivion from the Orc Hacker vs  Carbonite from the Shrouded.
** Orc Hacker MODs:
*** -3 Firewall MOD for using an Enemy Repeater.
**Shrouded MODs:
*** If a Saving Roll is required, the Attack Damage of Oblivion will suffer a -3 MOD from the Firewall.
