{{n4}}
This term refers to the Area of Effect of Hacking Programs. In Infinity N4 a Hacker’s Hacking Area matches their [[Zone of Control]], and the Zone of Control of [[Repeater]]s and [[Deployable Repeater]]s of either the Player or their Allies.

{{update | 1.3, Nov 2022}}
In addition, if a Hacker is within the Zone of Control of an Enemy Repeater or Deployable Repeater, their Hacking Area includes all Enemy {{erratahighlight}}Troopers on the game table. However, if the Enemy Trooper is not a [[Hacker]], any ARO or Hacking Program using the Enemy Repeater will fail its Requirements, and instead an [[Idle]] will be performed.{{erratahighlight-end}}

==Hacking Area and AROs==

{{update | 1.3, Nov 2022}}
Enemies entering or acting inside the Hacking Area of a Hacker while remaining outside that Hacker’s [[LoF]] and ZoC can be reacted to with Hacking Programs or with Reset.

{{erratahighblock}}
In the ARO Check steps of the [[Order Expenditure Sequence]], players can check if the Active Trooper is inside any Reactive Troopers' Hacking Areas. Measurements must always be made from the Active Trooper, checking a maximum of 8 inches from any point along their path, and from the Active Trooper’s Repeaters. If the measurements show that the Active Trooper is within the Hacking Area of the Reactive Trooper, they can declare a Hacking Program or Reset ARO, as mentioned above.

==[[HoloMask]] and Hacking Area==
When using an Enemy Repeater to include an Enemy Trooper in the Hacking Area, any ARO or Hacking Program against a Trooper who does not have the Hacker Special Skill on their real Unit Profile will fail its Requirements in the Resolution step of the Order, and instead an Idle will be performed. This will reveal that the Enemy Trooper is not a Hacker.

==HoloMask and Repeater==
Similarly, when using an Enemy Trooper's Repeater, if that Trooper is in HoloMask State and does not have a Repeater on their real Unit Profile then any ARO or Hacking Program using their fake Repeater will fail its Requirements in the Resolution step of the Order, and instead an Idle will be performed. This will reveal that the Enemy Trooper does not have a Repeater.{{erratahighblock-end}}

The Hacker may use their Hacking Programs in the area that includes the Zone of Control of the Repeater, the Deployable Repeater and their own Zone of Control.

{{update | 1.1.1, Dec 2021}}
{{erratahighlight}}In this example, [[Stealth]] is not being used.{{erratahighlight-end}}

During his Active Turn, the Shrouded Hacker decides to declare Idle as the first Short Skill of the Order. As shown in the picture, he is outside his enemies LoF {{erratahighlight}}and ZoC{{erratahighlight-end}}, but since he is a Hacker, he can use the Deployable Repeater, and the M-Drone Trooper (who carries the Repeater piece of Equipment), to increase his Hacking Area, allowing him to act from his current position.

{{erratahighlight}}As the Shrouded Hacker is inside the Orc Hacker’s Hacking Area, the Orc Hacker declares an ARO.{{erratahighlight-end}}

{{erratahighlight}}The Orc Hacker declares Oblivion.{{erratahighlight-end}}

The second Skill of the Shrouded Hacker is Carbonite, dividing his B2 between the Knight of Justice and the Orc Hacker.

{{erratahighlight}}The Knight of Justice has now been targeted by a Hacking Program, given she an ARO, and she declare Reset.{{erratahighlight-end}}

{{originalhighlight}}Therefore, since both the Knight of Justice and the Orc Trooper Hacker are clearly within the Hacking Area of the Shrouded Hacker, they each declare their AROs.{{originalhighlight-end}}

{{originalhighlight}}The Knight of Justice declares Reset as their ARO and the Orc Hacker declares Oblivion.{{originalhighlight-end}}

The second Skill of the Shrouded Hacker is Carbonite, dividing his B2 between the Knight of Justice and the Orc Hacker. 

{{originalhighlight}}During the Resolution of the Order, it is verified that both the Knight of Justice and the Orc Hacker are within the Hacking Area of the Shrouded Hacker.{{originalhighlight-end}}
{{original-end}}

The following Face to Face Rolls occur:
*Reset by the Knight of Justice vs Carbonite from the Shrouded.
** No Modifiers (MOD).
*Oblivion from the Orc Hacker vs  Carbonite from the Shrouded.
** Orc Hacker MODs:
*** -3 Firewall MOD for using an Enemy Repeater.
**Shrouded MODs:
*** If a Saving Roll is required, the Attack Damage of Oblivion will suffer a -3 MOD from the Firewall.

{{update | 1.3, Nov 2022}}
{{greybox-start | Example of Camouflaged State and ARO Through a Repeater }}
{{erratahighblock}}
This time, the Shrouded Hacker is in Camouflaged State and declares Idle.

As the Camouflaged Marker is inside the Orc Hacker's Hacking Area, the Orc Hacker can delay their ARO in case the Camouflaged Marker is a Hacker.

The Orc Hacker may declare an ARO only if the Camouflaged Marker reveals themselves with the second Short Skill of the Order.{{erratahighblock-end}}
