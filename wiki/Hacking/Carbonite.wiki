{{Requirements}}
*The target may only be an enemy Trooper with the [[Hackable]] Characteristic (HI, TAG, REM... or an enemy [[Hacker]]).
{{effects}}
*In the [[Active Turn]], this Program's [[Burst]] of 2 allows the user to perform two WIP Rolls, which can be distributed among one or more targets as usual.
*Each successful Roll, due to DA Ammunition, forces the target to make two [[Saving Roll]]s against BTS, with Damage 13.
* Any failed Saving Roll will cause the target to enter [[Immobilized-B State]], placing an Immobilized-B State Token (IMM-B) by them.
*A [[Critical]] with Carbonite forces its target to perform an additional [[Saving Roll]].
*The range of this Program is the Hacker's [[Hacking Area]].
