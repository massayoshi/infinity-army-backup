Some Troopers or Hacking Devices have pieces of Equipment which provide extra protection against [[Comms Attack]]s. These defenses are codified in the Firewall rule, which applies a series of MODs to hinder the Attack and enhance the target's protection.

{{Effects}}
* Any enemy that declares a [[Comms Attack]] against a Trooper benefitting from a Firewall will have to apply a negative MOD to his [[WIP]] Attribute, as indicated between brackets: Firewall (-3), Firewall (-6)... 
* A Trooper benefitting from a Firewall will apply a MOD of -3 to the [[Attack Damage]] of Comms Attacks if they have to perform a [[Saving Roll]].
* Troopers can only benefit from one Firewall at a time. If a Trooper can benefit from more than one Firewall, their player will decide which one to apply.

{{explain-start}}
The Firewall in a Comms Attack is the equivalent of Cover in a BS Attack, it hinders the Attack and aids the target's Saving Roll. 

Although the MOD to the Attack varies (-3, -6...), the MOD to the Saving Roll is always fixed (-3), unless a specific rule indicates otherwise.
