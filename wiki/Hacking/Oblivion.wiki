{{requirements}}
* The target must be an enemy with the [[Hackable]] Characteristic (HI, TAG, REM...) or an enemy [[Hacker]].
{{effects}}
* In the [[Active Turn]], this Program's [[Burst]] of 2 allows the user to perform two WIP Rolls, which can be distributed among one or more targets as usual.
* Each successful Roll, due to AP Ammunition, forces the target to make a [[Saving Roll]] against their halved BTS, with Damage 16.
* Any failed Saving Roll will cause the target to enter [[Isolated State]], placing an Isolated State Token (ISOLATED) by them.
* A [[Critical]] with Oblivion forces its target to perform an additional [[Saving Roll]], applying their halved BTS value.
* The range of this Program is the Hacker's [[Hacking Area]].
