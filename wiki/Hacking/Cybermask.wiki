{{skill-label | NFB, No Roll. }}
{{requirements}}
* The user must be outside the [[LoF]] of enemy Markers or Troopers.
{{effects}}
* The user enters the [[Impersonation State | Impersonation-2 state]], which does not require a Roll, replacing the user's model with an Impersonation-2 Marker (IMP-2).
* The effects of this Program persist until the user reveals themselves as per the Impersonation-2 state rules.
* This Program affects only the [[Hacker]] himself and therefore has no range.

{{remember-start}}
While the [[Hacker]] is in [[Impersonation State | IMP-2 State]], the Programâ€™s [[NFB]] Label applies, so they cannot use or apply any other Skill, piece of Equipment, or Hacking Program that has the NFB Label, for example [[Mimetism]], [[Albedo]], [[Holoprojector]] etc.
