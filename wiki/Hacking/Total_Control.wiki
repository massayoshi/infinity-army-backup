{{effects}}
* '''In the Active or Reactive Turn,''' this Program has a [[Burst]] of 1, allowing the user to perform one WIP Roll against the target.
* Each successful Roll, due to [[DA]] Ammunition, forces the target to make two [[Saving Roll]]s against BTS, with Damage 16.
* Any failed Saving Roll will cause the target to enter [[Possessed State]], placing a Possessed State Token (POS) by them.
**If the target is already in Possessed State, any failed Saving Roll will cancel the target's Possessed State, causing them to enter [[Normal State]].
* A [[Critical]] with Total Control forces its target to perform an additional [[Saving Roll]].
* The range of this Program is the Hacker's [[Hacking Area]].
