{{greybox-start | Example of Supportware Use and Cancellation }}
During their Active Turn, a Player that has two Troopers with EVO Hacking Devices on the table, declares Fairy Dust with one of them and chooses REMs as the Troop Type that will benefit from this Supportware.

For tactical reasons, they decide to spend the last Order on the other Trooper with an EVO Hacking Device to declare Enhanced Reaction on a REM located in the vanguard. 

By designating a REM that was already benefitting from Fairy Dust, the new Supportware Program deactivates the Fairy Dust Program and the corresponding Token is removed from the table.
