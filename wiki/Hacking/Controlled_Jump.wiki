a = <s>A: A Controlled Jump ARO is considered valid against a Combat Jump Entire Order anywhere on the table, or against any Skill in the Hacker’s Hacking Area.</s><br>
{{erratahighlight}}A: A Controlled Jump ARO can be declared against a Combat Jump Entire Order anywhere on the table, or against any Skill in the Hacker’s Hacking Area.{{erratahighlight-end}}<br>
As an ARO to a Combat Jump Entire Order, Controlled Jump is resolved before the Combat Jump PH Roll is resolved, and will affect that PH Roll. Alternatively, the Hacker can wait until the PH Roll has been resolved, and declare a non-Controlled Jump ARO, if applicable. |
