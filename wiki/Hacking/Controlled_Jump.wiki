{{effects}}
* When the user declares the use of this Program, which does not require a Roll, the Program's Effects are applied immediately, instead of in the [[Resolution]] step, and a Controlled Jump Supportware Token (Sup: Controlled Jump) is placed beside the user.
* If declared as an [[ARO]] to an enemy Trooper declaring [[Combat Jump]], this means that the -3 MOD will affect the enemy Trooper's [[PH]] Roll.
* It is not mandatory to declare Controlled Jump as an ARO to an enemy Trooper declaring Combat Jump, instead the Hacker can choose to wait and declare an ARO in the normal way.
* As long as Controlled Jump is active, when performing the Combat Jump Skill every Allied Trooper applies a +3 MOD while every Enemy Trooper must apply a -3 MOD. If both players have Controlled Jump active, the effects of both Programs are cancelled.
* A player cannot have more than one active Controlled Jump Program.
* This Program's range covers the entire game table.

{{important-start}} 
* This Program affects Troopers even if they donâ€™t have the [[Hackable]] Characteristic.
* Controlled Jump can be declared as an [[ARO]] against a [[Combat Jump]] Long Skill anywhere on the table.
