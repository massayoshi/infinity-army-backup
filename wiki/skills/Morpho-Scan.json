{{skillbox |green| MORPHO-SCAN | SHORT SKILL }}
{{skill-label | Comms Attack, No Roll, Optional, Zone of Control. }}
{{requirements}}
* The target must be an enemy [[Model]] possessing the [[Wounds]] Attribute and be in the user's [[Zone of Control]].
* Morpho-scan has no effect on enemy [[Markers]], or enemy Troopers possessing the [[STR]] Attribute.
{{effects}}
* This Skill doesn't require a Roll.
* Morpho-scan replaces the [[MOV]], [[CC]], [[BS]] and [[PH]] Attribute values of its user with the ones of its target.
* Morpho-scan imposes a MOD of -9 to its target if they declare a [[Reset]] ARO to prevent it, no matter what kind of Troop it is (LI, MI, HI...), and even if the Morpho-scan is declared outside of its [[LoF]].
* Once this Special Skill is used successfully, having replaced the owner's Attribute values with those of its target's, it cannot be used again during the game.
