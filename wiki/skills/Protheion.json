{{requirements}}
* In the [[Active]] or [[Reactive Turn]], the Trooper must reach or be in [[Silhouette]] contact with the target, and declare a CC Attack. 
* The target must have the [[Wounds]] Attribute. 
{{effects}}
* For each [[Wound]] inflicted upon the target of the [[CC Attack]], the user of Protheion will recover 1 [[Wounds]] point. If the user hasn't lost any [[Wounds]] points, they will increase their [[Wounds]] Attribute by 1.
* The [[Wounds]] Attribute cannot be more than '''two''' higher than its original value. 
* If the user's Wounds Attribute is higher than its original value, the player must place a Power-Up, or Power-Up 2 Token to indicate the current value of the Trooper's Wounds Attribute. 


== Examples ==
{{greybox-start | Example 1}}
A Caliban enters Close Combat against a Fusilier, who declares CC Attack as their ARO. The Caliban wins the fight and the Fusilier fails their [[Saving Roll]], thus becoming Unconscious. When the Order concludes, the Caliban places a Power-Up 1 Token besides himself, showing that his Wounds Attribute is now 2. 

During the next Order, the Caliban declares a CC Attack against the Unconscious Fusilier, performing a '''Coup de Gr&acirc;ce''' so that the target automatically passes from Unconscious to Dead State, without performing a [[Saving Roll]]. At the end of the Order, the Caliban places a Power-Up 2 Token besides himself, showing that his Wounds Attribute is now 3.

{{greybox-start | Example 2}}
{{image | name=eng-protheion-1024.jpg | style=512 }}

Sheskiin, who has lost one point of her Wounds Attribute during a previous engagement, uses her DA CC Weapon to CC Attack an Omega, who still has a Wounds Attribute of 2. Sheskiin wins the Roll, forcing the Omega to perform 2 [[Saving Rolls]] due to her DA CC Weapon. The Omega fails both Saving Rolls, loses 2 points to his Wounds Attribute and becomes Unconscious. Thanks to her Protheion Special Skill, Sheskiin recovers the previously lost Wounds point and gains an extra one, placing a Power-Up 1 Token next to her. If, during a later Order, she performed a '''[[Coup de Gr&acirc;ce]]''''' against the Omega, she would gain another extra Wound, placing a Power-Up 2 Token besides herself. Sheskiin would have a Wounds Attribute of 4 and the Omega would be removed from the game table.
