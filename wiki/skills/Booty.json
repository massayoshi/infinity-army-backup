Soldiers with this Special Skill have an uncanny ability to find equipment and gear during their field operations, and take some of it as a keepsake. As a consequence, each of them carries a different extra weapon or piece of equipment into battle.	

{{skillbox |purple| BOOTY | DEPLOYMENT SKILL }}
{{skill-label | Optional }}
* Booty allows a roll on the Booty Chart, after placing the Trooper on the table when it is deployed, in order to determine that Trooper's extra item.
* The item obtained via the Booty Chart is added to the Trooper's gear, and does '''not''' replace any of the Trooper's weapons or pieces of Equipment.
