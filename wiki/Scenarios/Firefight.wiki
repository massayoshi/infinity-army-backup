== Scenario Special Rules ==

=== Killing ===
Troopers are considered Killed by the adversary when they enter [[Dead State]], or they are in a [[Null]] State at the end of the game.

Troopers that '''have not been deployed on the game table''', as a [[Model]] or [[Marker]], at the end of the game will be considered to be Killed by the adversary.

=== Reinforced Tactical Link ===
In this mission, the identity of the [[Lieutenant]] is always [[Open Information]]. The player must indicate which Marker is the Lieutenant if it is in a [[Marker]] state.

The Lieutenant must be placed on the game table at the beginning of the first [[Game Round]], either as a model or as a Marker.

If players lack a Lieutenant at the start of the [[Tactical Phase]] of their Active Turn, because this Trooper was not deployed or because it is in a [[Null]] state ([[Unconscious]], [[Dead]]â€¦), then they must name a new Lieutenant, without Order expenditure. The identity of this new Lieutenant is also Open Information. It is compulsory such Lieutenant be a Model or a Marker placed on the game table.

=== Designated Landing Area ===
The whole game table is considered a Designated Landing Area. Troopers possessing the [[Combat Jump]] Special Skill can apply a +3 MOD to their deployment [[PH]] Roll. This MOD is cumulative with any other MOD provided by any other rule.

Additionally, Troopers who have a Special Skill with the [[Airborne Deployment]] Label (AD) will ignore the prohibition of deploying inside the enemy [[Deployment Zone]].

=== Specialist Troops ===
For the purposes of this scenario, only [[Doctor]]s, [[Engineer]]s, [[Forward Observer]]s, [[Hacker]]s, [[Paramedic]]s, [[Specialist Operative]]s, and Troopers possessing the [[Chain of Command]] Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.

Doctors and Engineers cannot make use of [[Peripheral]]s to perform tasks reserved for Specialist Troops.


== End of the Mission ==
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically finish at the end of the '''third [[Game Round]]'''.

If a player finds, during the [[Tactical Phase]] of his [[Player Turn]], that all Troopers in their [[Army List]] are in a [[Null]] state, the mission will finish at the end of this Player Turn.
