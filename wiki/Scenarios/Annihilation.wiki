== Forces and Deployment ==
SIDE A and SIDE B: Both players will deploy on opposite sides of the game table, in Deployment Zones whose size depends on the number of Army Points in the Army Lists.

== Scenario Special Rules ==

=== Killing ===
Troopers are considered Killed by the adversary when they enter [[Dead State]], or they are in a [[Null]] State at the end of the game.

Troopers that '''have not been deployed on the game table''', as a [[Model]] or [[Marker]], at the end of the game will be considered to be Killed by the adversary.


=== End of the Mission ===
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically finish at the end of the third [[Game Round]].

If a player finds, during the [[Tactical Phase]] of his [[Player Turn]], that all Troopers in their [[Army List]] are in a [[Null]] state, the mission will finish at the end of this Player Turn.
