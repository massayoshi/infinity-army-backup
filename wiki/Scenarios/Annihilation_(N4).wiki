== Scenario Special Rules ==

=== Killing ===
Troopers are considered ''Killed'' by the adversary when they enter ''Dead'' state, or they are in a ''Null'' state at the end of the game.

Troopers that '''have not been deployed on the game table''', as a Model or Marker, at the end of the game will be considered to be ''Killed'' by the adversary.

=== End of the Mission ===
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically finish at the end of the '''third Game Round'''.
