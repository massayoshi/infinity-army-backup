== Scenario Special Rules ==

=== Killing ===
Troopers are considered Killed by the adversary when they enter Dead state, or they are in a Null state at the end of the game.

Troopers that '''have not been deployed on the game table''', as a Model or Marker, at the end of the game will be considered to be Killed by the adversary.

=== Reinforced Tactical Link ===
In this mission, the identity of the [[Lieutenant]] is always Public Information. The player must indicate which Marker is the Lieutenant if it is in a Marker state.

The Lieutenant must be placed on the game table at the beginning of the first Game Round, either as a model or as a Marker.

If players lack a Lieutenant during the Tactical Phase of their Active Turn because this Trooper was not deployed or because it is in a Null state (Unconscious, Deadâ€¦), then they must name a new Lieutenant, without Order expenditure. The identity of this new Lieutenant is also Public Information. It is compulsory such Lieutenant be a Model or a Marker placed on the game table.

=== Designated Landing Area ===
The whole game table is considered a Designated Landing Area. Troopers possessing the [[Combat Jump]] Special Skill can apply a +3 MOD to their deployment PH Roll. This MOD is cumulative with any other MOD provided by any other rule.

Additionally, Troopers who have a Special Skill with the Airborne Deployment [[Label]] (AD) will ignore the prohibition of deploying inside the enemy Deployment Zone.

=== Specialist Troops ===
For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Specialist Operatives, Doctors, Engineers, and Paramedics are considered Specialist Troops.

Doctors and Engineers cannot make use of Peripherals to perform tasks reserved for Specialist Troops.

=== End of the Mission ===
This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically finish at the end of the '''third Game Round'''. 

If a player finds, during the Tactical Phase of his Player Turn, that all Troopers in their Army List are in a Null state, the mission will finish at the end of this Player Turn.
