{{cancellation}}
* The Trooper performs the [[Reload]] Common Skill, which does not require a Roll, while inside the [[Zone of Control]] of an [[Allied]] Trooper with the [[Baggage]] piece of Equipment. The Trooper with Baggage must be in a non-[[Null]] State.
* In the [[States Phase]], the Trooper is inside the Zone of Control of an Allied Trooper with the Baggage piece of Equipment. The Trooper with Baggage must be in a non-Null State.

* Canceling this state returns all weapons and pieces of Equipment with the [[Disposable]] Trait that the trooper possesses to their full capacity.
