{{skillbox |black| ISOLATED | }}
{{activation}}
* The Trooper suffered a successful Attack or Effect using an Ammunition, or a game condition or Scenario Special Rule, capable of causing this state.
{{effects}}
* Troopers in Isolated State cannot receive Orders from their [[Order Pool]].
* If, at the start of his following Active Turns, the Trooper is still Isolated, then he is considered to be [[Irregular]] and does not add his Order to his Order Pool this Turn. {{seefaq | This Order cannot be made Regular.}}
* While in Isolated State all the Trooper's Hacking Programs, Skills and pieces of Equipment with the [[Comms Attack]] or [[Comms Equipment]] Labels or Traits ([[Hacking Device]], [[Repeater]]...) are disabled.
* Additionally, if the Isolated Trooper is the army's [[Lieutenant]], then at the beginning of the player's next Active Turn the army enters a [[Loss of Lieutenant]] situation unless the state is cancelled before then.
* Troopers in this state must apply a '''-9 WIP MOD''' to their '''[[Reset]]''' rolls. {{seefaq | State MODs are cumulative.}}
* An Isolated Trooper ceases to be part of any kind of Infinity [[Fireteam]].
* If the Isolated Trooper is the [[Team Leader]] then the [[Fireteam]] will break.
* Troopers in Isolated State cannot take part in a [[Coordinated Order]].
* Automatic Special Skills and Equipment continue to work in this state, with the exception of [[Comms Attacks]] and [[Comms Equipment]].
{{cancellation}}
* A Trooper with the [[Engineer]] Special Skill (or an equivalent Skill) may cancel the state by spending one Short Skill of an Order while in [[Silhouette contact]] with the affected Trooper and succeeding at a Normal WIP Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario that caused the state).
* The affected Trooper may cancel this state via a successful Normal or Face to Face [[Reset]] Roll, applying the -9 WIP MOD provided by this state. 


{{important-start}}
If an army enters a [[Loss of Lieutenant]] situation because its [[Lieutenant]] was Isolated at the start of the Active Turn, canceling Isolated State in that Turn does not revoke the Loss of Lieutenant, as that situation may only be cancelled as indicated by its rules.
