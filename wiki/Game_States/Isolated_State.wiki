{{css_skillbox |black| ISOLATED STATE }}
{{activation}}
* The Trooper or game element ("Trooper" from now on) suffers a successful [[Attack]] or Effect using an [[Ammunition]], or a game condition or Scenario Special Rule, capable of causing this state.

{{effects}}
* '''Restriction:''' Troopers in Isolated State cannot receive [[Orders]] from their [[Order Pool]].
* '''Restriction:''' If, at the start of their following [[Active Turn]]s, the Trooper is still Isolated, then during that Turn they are [[Irregular]] and do not add his Order to their Order Pool.
* '''Restriction:''' The [[Irregular Order]] of an Isolated Trooper cannot be transformed in a [[Regular Order]].
* '''Restriction:''' While in Isolated State all the Trooper's Skills and pieces of Equipment with the [[Comms Attack]] or [[Comms Equipment]] Labels or Traits ([[Hacking Device]], [[Repeater]]...) are disabled. In addition, all their [[Hacking Program]]s are disabled. Other 'Automatic Special Skills and Equipment continue to work in this state.
* If the Isolated Trooper is the army's [[Lieutenant]], then at the beginning of the player's next Active Turn the army enters a [[Loss of Lieutenant]] situation unless the state is canceled before then.
* '''Restriction ''' If a Trooper with the [[NCO]] Special Skill is in Isolated State, they cannot replace [[Lieutenant Special Order | Special Lieutenant Orders]] with [[Tactical Order]]s or use them either.
* If a [[Peripheral]] or a Peripheral's Controller enters Isolated State, the Peripheral automatically enters [[Disconnected State]].
* Troopers in this state must apply a -9 [[WIP]] MOD to their [[Reset]] rolls.
* '''Restriction:''' A Trooper in Isolated State cannot be part of a [[Fireteam]]. If a member of a Fireteam enters Isolated State they automatically stop being part of the Fireteam. <br>In addition, remember that if the Isolated Trooper is the Team Leader the Fireteam will break.
* '''Restriction:''' Troopers in Isolated State cannot take part in a [[Coordinated Order]].

{{cancellation}}
* A Trooper with the [[Engineer]] Special Skill (or an equivalent Skill) may cancel the state by spending one [[Short Skill]] of an [[Trooper Activation | Order]] while in [[Silhouette contact]] with the affected Trooper and succeeding at a [[Normal]] [[WIP]] Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario that caused the state).
* The affected Trooper may cancel this state via a successful [[Normal]] or [[Face to Face Roll | Face to Face]] [[Reset]] Roll, applying the -9 WIP MOD provided by this state.
* If the army is in a [[Loss of Lieutenant]] situation as a result of the Lieutenant being in Isolated State, Canceling the Lieutenant's Isolated State does not cancel the Loss of Lieutenant situation.

'''[[Oblivion]]'''
* Any failed Saving Roll causes the target to enter [[Isolated State]], placing an Isolated State Token (ISOLATED) by them.


'''[[Electromagnetic (E/M) Ammunition]]'''
* A failed Saving Roll against E/M Ammunition causes the target to enter [[Isolated State]], placing an Isolated Token next to it, preventing it from receiving Orders from the [[Order Pool]].
