{{css_skillbox |black| PRONE STATE }}
{{activation}}
* During the '''[[Deployment Phase]]''', players may deploy one or more of their Troopers Prone by placing a Prone Token beside them.
* A Trooper may change its status from Normal to Prone, and vice versa, at '''either''' the start of their Movement '''or''' at the end of their Movement, by performing any [[Short Skill]] or [[ARO]] with the [[Movement Label]] (except for [[Jump]]) or as a result of a failed [[Guts Roll]]. However, this will affect their [[Silhouette]] and the distance they can move around the game table.
* If a Trooper enters '''[[Unconscious State]]''', it automatically enters Prone State unless it has the [[Motorcycle]] piece of Equipment, or it is a [[VH]] or [[TAG]], Troop Types that cannot enter Prone State.

{{effects}}
* Prone Troopers have a [[Silhouette]] (S) value of X, that is, equivalent to their base's height and width.
* While in this state, Troopers halve the distance they can move when performing any Skill with [[Movement Label]] ([[Move]], [[Dodge]]...), or when moving as the result of a failed [[Guts Roll]].
* This state does not affect Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, except when explicitly stated in their description.

{{cancellation}}
* A Trooper may change its status from Normal to Prone, and vice versa, at '''either''' the start of their Movement '''or''' at the end of their Movement, by performing any [[Short Skill]] or [[ARO]] with the [[Movement Label]] (except for [[Jump]]) or as a result of a failed [[Guts Roll]]. However, this will affect their [[Silhouette]] and the distance they can move around the game table.
* This state is automatically canceled when the [[Jump]] Common Skill is declared.
* Canceling a Trooper's '''[[Unconscious State]]''' automatically cancels their Prone State as well.

'''[[General Movement Rules]]'''
* When performing a Short Skill or ARO '''with the [[Movement Label]]''' (except for Jump), or when moving after failing a [[Guts Roll]], a Trooper may enter or leave [[Prone State]] at '''either''' the start of their Movement '''or''' the end of their Movement, at no cost.<br>However, if they move in Prone State, this will reduce the distance they can move.
