{{css_skillbox |black| IMMOBILIZED-A STATE }}
{{activation}}
* The Trooper or game element ("Trooper" from now on) suffers a successful [[Attack]] or Effect using an [[Ammunition]], [[Hacking Program]] or a game condition or Scenario Special Rule, capable of causing this state.
{{effects}}
* Troopers in Immobilized-A State cannot declare any Skill or [[ARO]], except '''[[Dodge]]''', applying a -6 [[PH]] MOD.
* Automatic Special Skills and Equipment continue to work, but the Trooper must still respect all declaration restrictions.
* Troopers in the Immobilized-A state State continue to provide [[Orders]] for their [[Order Pool]].

{{cancellation}}
* The affected Trooper may cancel this state via a successful [[Normal]] or [[Face to Face Roll | Face to Face]] [[Dodge]] Roll, applying the -6 [[PH]] MOD provided by this state.
* A Trooper with the [[Engineer]] Special Skill (or an equivalent Skill) may cancel the Immobilized-A state by spending one [[Short Skill]] of an [[Trooper Activation | Order]] while in [[Silhouette contact]] with the affected Trooper, and passing a [[Normal]] [[WIP]] Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario).

'''[[Paralysis (PARA) Ammunition]]'''
* If the target fails the [[PH]]-6 Roll, it enters [[Immobilized-A State]]. Place an Immobilized-A Marker (IMM A) next to it.


'''[[Replacing Game Elements]]'''<br>
: If the space available is less than the volume determined by the [[silhouette]] template, the replacement Trooper will enter the [[Immobilized-A State]]. This State can only be cancelled by the conditions of the space containing the Trooper changing, and may not be cancelled in the usual manner defined by the State itself. Pieces of Equipment will be removed from the gaming table instead of entering the Immobilized-A State.

{{greybox| BS Attack Against a Trooper in Immobilized-A State}}
Let's suppose a Trooper is in Immobilized-A state.

Then, the Active Trooper spends an [[Order]], declares [[Move]] + [[BS Attack]], and uses their Spitfire against the Immobilized-A Trooper.

In this state, the Immobilized-A Trooper may only declare [[Dodge]] as their [[ARO]], with a -6 MOD.

Therefore, a [[Face to Face Roll]] of 4 Spitfire shots is made against 1 Dodge Roll.

The Immobilized-A Trooper will apply the following MODs to the Dodge Roll:
* -6 for Immobilized-A.
With a PH Attribute of 10, the Success Value (SV) will be 10 - 6 = 4. 

The Active Trooper will apply the following MODs to the BS Attack Roll:
* +3 for Range.
* -3 for Cover.
With a BS Attribute of 13, the Success Value (SV) will be 13 + 3 - 3 = 13. 

Resolution:<br>
The Immobilized-A Trooper loses the Face to Face Roll, so he suffers 3 Spitfire hits, since the 4th (with a result of 14) is a miss for the Active Trooper.

{{erratahighlight}}However, if the Immobilized-A Trooper wins the Dodge Roll, then they not only would dodge the incoming hits, but also cancel their Immobilized-A State.{{erratahighlight-end}}
