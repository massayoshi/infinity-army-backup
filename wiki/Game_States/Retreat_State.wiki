{{css_skillbox |black|  RETREAT! STATE }}
{{activation}}
* At the beginning of the [[Player Turn]], the Trooper's army enters the [[Retreat! situation]].

{{effects}}
* When the Retreat! situation is declared at the beginning of a player's [[Active Turn]], that player places a Retreat! Token (RETREAT!) beside each of their surviving troops.
* The Trooper can only use [[Basic Short Skill]]s, [[Cautious Movement]], [[Dodge]], or [[Reset]] (or any Special Skills that explicitly say so). 
* Troopers in [[Holoecho State | Holoprojector]] or [[HoloMask State]], or any Marker State, cancel the state when they enter Retreat! State.
* This state does not interfere with Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, which will remain functioning normally.
* Troopers with the [[Courage]], [[Religious Troop]], or [[Warhorse]] Special Skills, or any other Special Skill that protects them from the effects of the Retreat! situation, do not enter Retreat! State.

{{cancellation}}
* At the beginning of the player's Turn, their army leaves the [[Retreat! situation]].
* The Retreat! State of a Trooper can be cancelled by spending a [[Command Token]]. That Trooper will ignore the effects of Retreat! State until the end of the game.
