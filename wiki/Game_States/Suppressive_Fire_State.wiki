{{css_skillbox |black| SUPPRESSIVE FIRE STATE }}
{{activation}}
* The Trooper declared the [[Suppressive Fire]] [[Long Skill]].
{{effects}}
* Enemy Troopers within Suppressive Fire Range (0-24 inches) apply a -3 MOD to their Attribute in all [[Face to Face Roll]]s against a Trooper in Suppressive Fire State.
* While in Suppressive Fire State, the SF Mode profile replaces the selected weapon's usual BS Weapon profile. The SF Mode profile is the one that will be used while in Suppressive Fire State.
* Suppressive Fire allows the affected Trooper to react in [[ARO]] with the full B3 value of the SF Mode. The full [[Burst]] must always be directed against a single target and cannot be divided between several active enemies (when reacting against a [[Coordinated Order]], for example).
* The SF Mode profile only alters the [[Range]] and [[B]] values of the weapon being used. The weapon's PS, Ammunition, etc. remain unchanged.
* This state does not interfere with Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, which will remain functioning normally.

{{cancellation}}
Suppressive Fire State is automatically canceled in any of these cases:
* The Trooper declares an [[Trooper Activation | Order]].
* The Trooper declares any [[ARO]] other than a [[BS Attack]] using the SF Mode profile.
* The Trooper uses a weapon that does not have the Suppressive Fire Trait.
* The Trooper fails a [[Guts Roll]].
* The Trooper enters [[Engaged]], [[Isolated]] or [[Retreat! State]], any [[Null]] or [[Immobilized State]], or any other State which specifies that it cancels Suppressive Fire.
* The Trooper's army enters a [[Loss of Lieutenant]] situation.
* The Trooper joins any [[Fireteam]].
