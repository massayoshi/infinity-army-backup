{{skillbox |black| SUPPRESSIVE FIRE | }}
{{activation}}
* The Trooper declared a [[Suppressive Fire]] Entire Order. 
{{effects}}
* Enemy Troopers within Suppressive Fire Range (0-24 inches) apply a -3 MOD to their Attribute in all Face to Face Rolls against a Trooper in Suppressive Fire State.
* While in Suppressive Fire State, the SF Mode profile replaces the selected weapon's usual BS Weapon profile. The SF Mode profile is the one that will be used while in Suppressive Fire State.
* Suppressive Fire allows the affected Trooper to react in ARO with the full B3 value of the Suppressive Fire Mode. The full Burst must always be directed against a single target and cannot be divided between several active enemies (when reacting against a Coordinated Order, for example).
* The SF Mode profile only alters the Range and B values of the weapon being used. The weapon's Damage, Ammunition etc. remains unchanged.
* This State does not interfere with Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, which will remain functioning normally.
{{cancellation}}
The Suppressive Fire state is automatically cancelled in any of these cases:
* The Trooper declares an Order.
* The Trooper declares any ARO other than a [[BS Attack]] using the SF Mode profile.
* The Trooper uses a weapon that cannot be used for Suppressive Fire.
* The Trooper fails a [[Guts Roll]].
* The Trooper enters [[Engaged]], [[Isolated]] or [[Retreat! State]], any [[Null]] or [[Immobilized]] State, or any other State which specifies that it cancels Suppressive Fire.
* The Trooper's army enters a [[Loss of Lieutenant]] situation.
* The Trooper joins any kind of Infinity [[Fireteam]].

a = A: The Trooper has not declared an Order, and will not trigger enemy Deployable Weapons etc. However, any States, Fireteam membership etc. that would be cancelled by declaring a Suppressive Fire Entire Order will be cancelled. |
