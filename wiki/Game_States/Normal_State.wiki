{{css_skillbox |black| NORMAL STATE }}
{{activation}}
* Unless otherwise noted, all Troopers and game elements ("Trooper" from now on) deploy in this state.
* Troopers in any [[Null]] State revert to the Normal State if their Null States are cancelled.
* Therefore, Troopers in [[Unconscious State]] revert to Normal State if a [[Wound]] is removed.

{{effects}}
* The Trooper generates 1 [[Order]] for their player to use during the [[Tactical Phase]].
* The Trooper counts towards the player's [[Victory Points]].

{{cancellation}}
* Normal State is canceled when the Trooper enters any [[Null]] State ([[Unconscious]], [[Dead]]...) or when the effect of a Special Skill, weapon or piece of Equipment indicates so.
