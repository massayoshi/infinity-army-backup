{{skillbox |black| Normal State |}}
{{activation}}
* Unless otherwise noted, all Troopers deploy in this state. 
* Troopers in any [[Null]] State revert to the Normal State if their Null States are cancelled.
: Therefore, Troopers in the [[Unconscious]] State revert to the Normal State if they recover at least 1 point of their [[Wounds]] or [[Structure]] Attribute.
{{effects}}
* The Trooper generates 1 Order for their players to use during the [[Tactical Phase]]. 
* The Trooper counts towards the Player's [[Victory Points]]. 

{{cancellation}}
* The Normal state is cancelled when the Trooper enters any [[Null]] State ([[Unconscious]], [[Dead]]...) or when the effect of a Special Skill, weapon or piece of Equipment indicates so.
