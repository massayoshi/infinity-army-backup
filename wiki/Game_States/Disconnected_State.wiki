{{activation}}
* The Controller of this Trooper is in [[Isolated State]] or any [[Null]] State.
* The [[Peripheral]] fails a [[Coherency]] Check.
* The Peripheral is subject to a successful Attack or Effect of an [[Ammunition]], [[Hacking Program]], condition, or Scenario Special Rule that specifies that it causes this state.
* The Peripheral is in [[Isolated State]].

{{effects}}
* '''Restriction:''' The Peripheral cannot be activated or declare [[Trooper Activation | Orders]] or [[ARO]]s.
* Automatic Special Skills and Automatic Equipment have no effect while in this state, with the exception of the Peripheral Special Skill. 
* '''Restriction:''' The Peripheral does not count towards the Player's [[Victory Points]].

{{cancellation}}
* This state is automatically canceled if the Controller of this Peripheral recovers from the [[Isolated State]] or [[Null]] State which activated the Disconnected State.
* If this state was caused by an Attack, a piece of scenery, or a Scenario Special Rule applied to this Trooper, then a Trooper with the [[Engineer]] Special Skill (or an equivalent Skill) may cancel this state by spending one Short Skill of an Order while in [[Silhouette contact]] with the affected Trooper, and passing a [[Normal]] [[WIP]] Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario).
* If this state was caused by failing a [[Coherency]] Check, it is automatically canceled by passing a Coherency Check at the end of an [[Trooper Activation | Order]] or [[ARO]].
