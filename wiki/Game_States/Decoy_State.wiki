{{css_skillbox |black| DECOY STATE }}
{{activation}}
{{update | PDF 5.2, October 2025}}
* Automatic when deployed {{erratahighlight}}for Troopers with the [[Decoy]] Skill{{erratahighlight-end}}.
{{update-end}}

{{effects}}
* When deploying, this state allows the user to deploy up to two Decoy Markers (DECOY-1 / DECOY-2) in addition to the Trooper, within [[Coherency]] of the user's Model and respecting the general conditions of the [[Deployment rules]].
* The number of additional Decoys that the Trooper may place during their Deployment is indicated between brackets: Decoy (1) or Decoy (2).
* If the user deploys in Marker form instead of as a Model, for example in [[Camouflaged]] or [[Impersonation State]]s, the player places (CAMO) and (IMP) Markers on the table instead of the Decoy Markers.
* The Trooper with this Special Skill is represented by up to three Decoys: the Decoy 1 Marker, the Decoy 2 Marker and the actual Model, or Marker if the user has that choice. The player must note in secret which of these Decoys represents the real user of this Special Skill, with the others being mere replicas.
* The replicas do not hide a Trooper, Weapon or piece of Equipment and they '''remain static on the gaming table'''.
* DECOY-1 and DECOY-2 Markers are placed on the gaming table when a Trooper is replicated in Model form, so they must be considered as Models for [[LoF]] purposes and may be targeted.

{{cancellation}}
* A replica Decoy must be automatically removed from the gaming table as soon as:
** It is [[Discover]]ed.
** It is hit by a successful [[Attack]]. In this case, the replica Decoy does not make the [[Saving Roll]] and is simply removed.
** An enemy Model enters [[Silhouette contact]] with it.
** The Trooper with this Special Skill reveals themself or is Discovered.
* The real Decoy user is revealed, removing all the replicas and placing the Trooper in its real position, whenever:
** The Decoy user declares an [[Attack]], [[Look Out]]!, or any Skill that requires a [[Roll]], other than [[Combat Jump]].
** The Decoy user declares a [[Long Skill]] of any kind, other than [[Cautious Movement]], [[Parachutist]], or Combat Jump.
** The Decoy user fails an [[Infiltration]] Roll or a Combat Jump Roll.
** An enemy Model enters Silhouette contact with the Decoy user, or vice-versa.
** The Decoy user is Discovered.
** The Decoy user is forced to make a Saving Roll.
** The Decoy user becomes [[Impetuous]] (due to the [[Frenzy]] Special Skill or any other effect) or enters [[Retreat State | Retreat! State]].
* If the user was hidden as a Decoy Marker, the player must replace the Marker with the corresponding Model, facing in any direction the player chooses.
* When replacing the Marker with the Model, the player must provide their adversary with the Trooper's complete [[Open Information]].

'''[[Decoy]]'''
* Allows its user to deploy in [[Decoy State]] when they are placed on the table.

{{important}}
'''Decoys, weapons, Equipment and States:'''<br>
The replicas cannot replicate those Deployable weapons or pieces of Equipment represented by a Token or Model ([[TinBot]]s, [[FastPanda]]s, [[SymbioMate]]s, [[Mines]] deployed by the [[Minelayer]] Special Skill...) the Decoy user could have.

However, the replicas duplicate all the State Tokens ([[Prone]], [[Unloaded]]...) the Decoy user has, and the Effects of Skills that impose MODs on the opponent ([[Albedo]], [[Mimetism]]...).

'''Decoy and Fireteam:'''<br>
A Trooper using Decoy cannot be part of a [[Fireteam]]. If a member of a Fireteam is deployed using Decoy, then it will automatically cease being part of the Fireteam.

'''Decoy and Coordinated Orders:'''<br>
Troopers using Decoy cannot be part of [[Coordinated Orders]].

'''Decoy and Airborne Deployment:'''<br>
When deploying a Trooper using Decoy and a Skill with the [[Airborne Deployment]] Label, the player must perform a [[Coherency]] Check as if it were the [[Deployment Phase]], even though this is during the game.

q = Q: During your main part of the Deployment Phase, can you reposition Troopers, Deployables, etc? |
a = A: In their main Deployment Phase step, players can reposition Troopers, Deployables, etc. As soon as a Roll or measurement is made for those game elements, their position is fixed, and they cannot be repositioned during the Deployment Phase.

For example, you can reposition a Trooper as many times as you want, but after you create a Fireteam and adjust the placement of the Fireteam members during the Coherency Check, you can no longer reposition any member of that Fireteam. |

q = Q: In the Deployment Phase do you have to check ZoC when a Trooper uses Minelayer, or Coherency when deploying Decoys or Holoechoes? |
a = A: Yes, but your opponent must look away so that you can check the ZoC/Coherency without revealing Private Information. |
