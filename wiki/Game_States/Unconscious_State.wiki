If a target receives '''as many [[Wounds]]''' as the value of its [[VITA]]/[[STR]] Attribute, it enters [[Unconscious State]].

On the other hand, if the target receives '''more Wounds''' than the value of its VITA/STR Attribute, it enters [[Dead State]].

{{css_skillbox |red| UNCONSCIOUS STATE }}
{{skill-label | Null }}
{{activation}}
* A Trooper or game element ("Trooper" from now on) receives as many [[Wounds]] as their [[VITA]]/[[STR]] Attribute value.

{{effects}}
* '''Restriction:''' Troopers in this state cannot declare [[Trooper Activation | Orders]] or [[ARO]]s.
* Unconscious Troopers automatically enter '''[[Prone State]]''' unless they are a Troop Type unable to do so.
* Troopers in this state do not contribute [[Orders]] during the [[Tactical Phase]].
* Automatic Special Skills and Automatic Equipment have no effect while in this state.
* The Trooper does not count towards the Player's [[Victory Points]].
{{update | PDF 5.2, October 2025}}
* {{erratahighlight}}Troopers in Unconscious State still belong to their [[Combat Group]].{{erratahighlight-end}}
{{update-end}}

{{cancellation}}
* A [[Wound]] is removed from the Trooper, leaving them with less Wounds than their [[VITA]]/[[STR]] Attribute value.
* [[Doctors]] can remove Wounds from Troopers with the VITA Attribute, while [[Engineers]] can remove Wounds from Troopers with the STR Attribute. In both cases, the Wound is removed by performing the Doctor/Engineer Special Skill while in [[Silhouette contact]] with the affected Trooper, and passing a [[Normal]] [[WIP]] Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario).
* Other Special Skills and pieces of Equipment allow the removal of Wounds as indicated in their rules.
* Canceling '''Unconscious''' State automatically cancels '''[[Prone]]''' State as well.

{{see-also}}
'''[[Dogged]]'''
* The Unconscious State of Troopers using the Dogged Special Skill has the following special rules: <br>[...]
* Allows the Trooper to ignore the effects and [[Null]] Label of Unconscious State, treating it as [[Normal State]] instead, but only for the rest of that Player Turn.


'''[[No Wound Incapacitation]]'''
* The Unconscious State of Troopers using the No Wound Incapacitation Special Skill has the following special rules: <br>[...]
* Allows the Trooper to ignore the effects and [[Null]] Label of Unconscious State, treating it as [[Normal State]] instead.


'''[[Shasvastii]]'''
* The Unconscious State of Troopers using the Shasvastii Special Skill (usually referred to as 'Shasvastii-Embryo') has the following special rules: <br>[...]
* '''During the game''', the Trooper is counted when calculating [[Victory Points]] for the [[Retreat Situation | Retreat! situation]], and for any other rules or conditions required by the scenario.


'''[[Remote Presence]]'''
* Troopers with Remote Presence and the [[STR]] Attribute have two distinct levels of [[Unconscious State]].
* When the Trooper receives as many [[Wounds]] as their STR Attribute value, they enter Unconscious State like any other Trooper. However, if the Trooper receives one Wound more than its STR value, they do not enter [[Dead State]] as usual, but instead enter a second level of Unconscious State, signified by a second Unconscious Token (UNCONSCIOUS)...


'''[[MediKit]]'''
* A MediKit's target must be an [[Allied]] Model with the [[VITA]] Attribute and in [[Unconscious State]], unless certain scenario rules say otherwise. <br>[...]
* In both cases, by passing the PH Roll, the target may remove one [[Wound]] and cancel their [[Unconscious State]]. If the PH Roll is failed, the target automatically enters [[Dead State]] and is removed from the game table.


'''[[GizmoKit]]'''
* The target of a GizmoKit must be an [[Allied]] Model with the [[STR]] Attribute. <br>[...]
* In both cases, by passing the PH Roll, the target removes a [[Wound]]. This cancels [[Unconscious State]] if applicable. If the PH Roll is failed, the target receives a Wound instead of removing it, entering Unconscious or [[Dead State]] if applicable.


'''[[Regeneration]]'''
* During the States Phase, the user makes a [[Normal]] [[PH]] Roll:
** If the Roll is a success, the Trooper removes 1 [[Wound]], cancelling the [[Unconscious State]] if applicable.
** If the Roll fails, the Trooper receives 1 additional [[Wound]].


'''[[Shock Ammunition]]'''
* If the target has the '''[[VITA]] Attribute, with a value of 1''', any failed Saving Rolls against Shock Ammunition will also cancel any type of [[Unconscious State]] the target is in, or has entered during this Order, and the target passes directly to [[Dead State]].


'''[[CC Attack]] > [[Coup de Gr&acirc;ce]]'''
* '''Coup de Gr&acirc;ce''': When declaring the CC Attack, if the [[Enemy]] [[Target]] is in [[Unconscious State]] (including if it is represented by a Shasvastii-Embryo Token), then, without needing to perform a roll, the target automatically goes from Unconscious to [[Dead State]] without the possibility of making a [[Saving Roll]].<br>Coup de Gr&acirc;ce cannot be used against a Trooper who has activated the '''[[Dogged]]''' or '''[[No Wound Incapacitation]]''' Special Skill. Therefore, the CC Attack is resolved normally.
