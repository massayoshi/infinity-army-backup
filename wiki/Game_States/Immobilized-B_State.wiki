{{activation}}
* The Trooper or game element ("Trooper" from now on) suffers a successful [[Attack]] or Effect using an [[Ammunition]], [[Hacking Program]] or a game condition or Scenario Special Rule, capable of causing this state.

{{effects}}
* Troopers in Immobilized-B State cannot declare any Skill, [[Attack]] or [[ARO]], except [[Reset]] applying a -3 [[WIP]] MOD.
* Automatic Special Skills and Equipment continue to work, but the Trooper must still respect all declaration restrictions.
* Troopers in the Immobilized-B state continue to provide [[Orders]] for their [[Order Pool]].

{{cancellation}}
* The affected Trooper may cancel this state via a successful [[Normal]] or [[Face to Face Roll | Face to Face]] [[Reset]] Roll, applying the -3 [[WIP]] MOD provided by this state.
* A Trooper with the '''[[Engineer]]''' Special Skill (or an equivalent Skill) may cancel the Immobilized-B state by spending one [[Short Skill]] of an [[Trooper Activation | Order]] while in [[Silhouette contact]] with the affected Trooper, and passing a [[Normal]] [[WIP]] Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario).

'''[[Carbonite]]'''
* Any failed Saving Roll causes the target to enter '''[[Immobilized-B State]]''', placing an Immobilized-B State Token (IMM-B) by them.


'''[[Electromagnetic (E/M) Ammunition]]'''
* If the target fails a [[Saving Roll]] and is Heavy Infantry ([[HI]]), a [[TAG]], a Remote ([[REM]]), or a Vehicle ([[VH]]), then it also enters [[Immobilized-B State]]. Place an Immobilized-B Token (IMM-B) next to it in addition to the [[Isolated]] Token.


'''[[Mines#Cybermines | Cybermines]]'''
* However, any Troopers with the '''[[Hackable]] Characteristic ([[HI]], [[REM]], [[TAG]], [[VH]]...)''' and '''[[Hackers]]''' who fail either [[Saving Roll]] enter '''[[Immobilized-B State]]''' instead of [[Stunned State]].
