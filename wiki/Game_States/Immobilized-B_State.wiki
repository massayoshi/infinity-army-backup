{{skillbox |black| IMMOBILIZED-B | }}
{{Activation}}
*The Trooper suffered a successful Attack or Effect using an [[Ammunition]], [[Hacking Program]] or a game condition or Scenario Special Rule, capable of causing this state. 
{{Effects}}
*Troopers in Immobilized-B State cannot declare any Skill, Attack or ARO, except [[Reset]] applying a -3 [[WIP]] [[MOD]]. {{seefaq | State MODs are cumulative.}}
*Automatic [[Special Skills]] and [[Equipment]] continue to work, but the Trooper must still respect all declaration restrictions. 
*Troopers in the Immobilized-B state continue to provide Orders for their [[Order Pool]].
{{Cancellation}}
* The affected Trooper may cancel this state via a successful Normal or Face to Face [[Reset]] Roll, applying the -3 [[WIP]] [[MOD]] provided by this state.
* A Trooper with the '''[[Engineer]]''' Special Skill (or an equivalent Skill) may cancel the Immobilized-B state by spending one Short Skill of an Order while in [[Silhouette contact]] with the affected Trooper, and passing a Normal '''[[WIP]]''' Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario).
