{{css_skillbox |black| TARGETED STATE }}
{{activation}}
* The Trooper or game element ("Trooper" from now on) suffers a successful [[Attack]] or Effect using an [[Ammunition]], [[Hacking Program]] or a game condition or Scenario Special Rule, capable of causing this state.

{{effects}}
* Any Trooper declaring a [[BS Attack]], [[Comms Attack]], or [[Discover]] against a Trooper in Targeted State gains a '''+3 MOD''' to the [[Attribute]] used to perform that Skill.
* Troopers in this state must apply a -3 WIP MOD to their '''[[Reset]]''' rolls.
* '''Restriction:''' While in this state, '''[[Cautious Movement]]''' may not be declared.
* '''Restriction:''' A Trooper in this state may not use the '''[[Stealth]]''' Special Skill.
* This state does not interfere with Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, which will function normally.

{{cancellation}}
* The affected Trooper successfully passes a [[Normal]] or [[Face to Face Roll | Face to Face]] [[Reset]] Roll, applying a -3 [[WIP]] MOD.
* A Trooper with the '''[[Engineer]]''' Special Skill (or an equivalent Skill) may cancel the state by spending one [[Short Skill]] of an [[Trooper Activation | Order]] while in [[Silhouette contact]] with the affected Trooper, and passing a [[Normal]] [[WIP]] Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario).

'''[[Spotlight]]'''
* Any failed [[Saving Roll]] causes the target to enter [[Targeted State]], placing a Targeted State Token (TARGETED) by them.


'''[[Forward Observer]]'''
* The use of Forward Observer is a form of Attack with a [[BS Weapon]] with the [[BS Weapon (WIP)]] Trait, and instead of forcing the target to make a [[Saving Roll]], causes them to enter [[Targeted State]].
