{{skillbox |black| STUNNED | }}
{{activation}}
* The Trooper suffered a successful Attack or Effect using an Ammunition, Hacking Program or a game condition or Scenario Special Rule, capable of causing this state.
{{effects}}
* Troopers in this state cannot declare Attacks.
* Moreover, Troopers in Stunned State must apply a MOD of -3 to any Roll they perform, except [[Saving Rolls]].
* Automatic Special Skills and Equipment continue to work, but the Trooper must still respect all declaration restrictions.
{{cancellation}}
* To cancel this State, Troopers with the '''[[Wounds]]''' Attribute require a '''[[Doctor]]''', while Troopers with the '''[[Structure]] (STR)''' Attribute require an '''[[Engineer]]'''.
* A Trooper with the '''[[Doctor]]/[[Engineer]]''' Special Skill (or an equivalent Skill) may cancel this State by spending one Short Skill of an Order while in [[Silhouette contact]] with the affected Trooper, and passing a Normal '''WIP''' Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario).
* The Stunned State is automatically cancelled at the start of the [[States Phase]] of the Player Turn in which it was caused.
