{{css_skillbox |black| STUNNED STATE }}
{{activation}}
* The Trooper or game element ("Trooper" from now on) suffers a successful [[Attack]] or Effect using an [[Ammunition]], [[Hacking Program]], or a game condition or Scenario Special Rule, capable of causing this state.
{{effects}}
* '''Restriction:''' Troopers in this state cannot declare [[Attack]]s.
* Moreover, Troopers in Stunned State must apply a MOD of -3 to any Roll they perform, except [[Saving Rolls]].
* Automatic Special Skills and Equipment continue to work, but the Trooper must still respect all declaration restrictions.

{{cancellation}}
* To cancel this state, Troopers with the '''[[Vitality]] (VITA)''' Attribute require a [[Doctor]] while Troopers with the '''[[Structure]] (STR)''' Attribute require an [[Engineer]].
* A Trooper with the '''Doctor/Engineer''' Special Skill (or an equivalent Skill) may cancel this state by spending one [[Short Skill]] of an [[Trooper Activation | Order]] while in [[Silhouette contact]] with the affected Trooper and passing a [[Normal]] [[WIP]] Roll (or the Roll specified by the Special Skill or Scenario). 
* The Stunned State is automatically canceled at the start of the [[States Phase]] of the [[Player Turn]] in which it was caused.

'''[[Stun Ammunition]]'''
* A failed Saving Roll against Stun Ammunition causes the target to enter [[Stunned State]]. Place a Stunned State Token (STUNNED) next to it.


'''[[Mines#Cybermines | Cybermines]]'''
* Troopers who are hit by a Cybermine must make '''two''' [[Saving Rolls]] against [[BTS]], with PS 5. If the target fails either [[Saving Roll]], it enters '''[[Stunned]]''' State. 
* However, any Troopers with the '''[[Hackable]] Characteristic ([[HI]], [[REM]], [[TAG]], [[VH]]...)''' and '''[[Hackers]]''' who fail either Saving Roll enter '''[[Immobilized-B]]''' State instead of Stunned State.
