* The Trooper or game element ("Trooper" from now on) suffers a successful [[Attack]] or Effect using an [[Ammunition]], [[Hacking Program]] or a game condition or Scenario Special Rule, capable of causing this state.
{{effects}}
* '''Restriction:''' Troopers in this state '''cannot be activated or receive [[Orders]] from their player's [[Order Pool]].''' While they are Possessed, Troopers are considered to be [[enemy | enemies]] by the rest of their owner's Troopers and are considered to be [[allied | allies]] by the Troopers of the player that caused this game state.
* Troopers in this state do '''not''' contribute [[Orders]] during the [[Tactical Phase]]s of either player.
* Troopers in this state may be activated and receive Orders from the [[Order Pool]] of the [[Combat Group]] of the Trooper who caused them to enter the Possessed state. A Possessed Trooper does not count towards the maximum number of members the Combat Group may contain.
* Possessed Troopers must use the Possessed Trooper profile instead of their own.

Note* Use the Trooper's original [[Attribute]] values.
* This state does not interfere with Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, which will remain functioning normally.
* A Possessed Trooper does '''not''' count towards either Players' [[Victory Points]].
* '''Restriction:''' A Trooper in Possessed State cannot be part of a [[Fireteam]]. If a member of a Fireteam enters Possessed State they automatically stop being part of the Fireteam. 

{{cancellation}}
* In the owning player's [[Tactical Phase]], during the [[Executive Use of Command Tokens]] step, the player can automatically cancel this state by spending 1 [[Command Token]].
* The Possessed State is automatically canceled if the owning player successfully affects the Possessed Trooper with the [[Total Control]] Hacking Program.

{{see-also}}
'''[[Total Control]]'''
* Any failed [[Saving Roll]] causes the target to enter [[Possessed State]], placing a Possessed State Token (POS) by them. If this Program is used against a [[TAG]] in Possessed State, any failed Saving Roll cancels the target's Possessed State, causing them to enter [[Normal State]], and the Possessed State Token (POS) is removed.
