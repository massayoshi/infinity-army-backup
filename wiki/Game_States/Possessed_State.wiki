'''[[Total Control]]'''
* Any failed [[Saving Roll]] causes the target to enter [[Possessed State]], placing a Possessed State Token (POS) by them. If this Program is used against a [[TAG]] in Possessed State, any failed Saving Roll cancels the target's Possessed State, causing them to enter [[Normal State]], and the Possessed State Token (POS) is removed.
