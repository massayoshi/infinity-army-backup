{{css_skillbox |black| IMPERSONATION  }}
{{skill-label | Marker }}
{{activation}}
* Automatic during the [[Deployment Phase]], provided the user passes any [[WIP]] Roll that is necessary.
* During the [[Active Turn]], Troopers may only return to this state by spending a [[Long Skill]], while outside the [[LoF]] of [[enemy]] Markers or Troopers.
* This state may also be activated as indicated by Special Skills, [[Hacking Programs]], etc.

{{effects}}
* '''Restriction:''' Troopers cannot enter [[Silhouette contact]] with an [[enemy]] Impersonation Marker.
* '''Restriction:''' Troopers cannot declare [[Attacks]] against Impersonation-1 Markers (IMP-1).
* '''Restriction:''' Troopers cannot declare Attacks against Impersonation-2 Markers (IMP-2), it is required to [[Discover]] that Marker first (Discover + Attack maneuver).
* '''Restriction:''' As noted above, an '''[[Intuitive Attack]]''' may not be declared against a Trooper in Impersonation-1 State or Impersonation-2 State.
* '''Restriction:''' A Trooper that fails a [[WIP]] Roll to Discover an Impersonation Marker cannot attempt to Discover the same Marker until the next Player Turn. Note that a Trooper that has been revealed, and re-entered Impersonation State again, does not count as the same Marker.
* An Impersonation Marker has a 360&#730; [[LoF]].
* An Impersonation Marker has the same '''[[Silhouette]]''' (S) value as the Trooper it represents.
* This state does not interfere with Automatic Special Skills or Automatic Equipment, which will remain functioning normally.
* '''Restriction:''' A Trooper in Impersonation State cannot be part of a [[Fireteam]]. If a member of a Fireteam enters Impersonation State they automatically stop being part of the Fireteam.
* '''Restriction:''' The only [[ARO]]s that can be declared against an Impersonation Marker are: [[Discover]], [[Dodge]], [[Look Out]]! or [[Reset]].
* When a Trooper in Impersonation State is activated, each Reactive Trooper can delay the declaration of their ARO until the second half of the Active Trooper's Order has been declared. In this case:
* If the Trooper in Impersonation State reveals themselves with the second half of their Order (by declaring a [[BS Attack]], moving into [[Silhouette contact]] with an [[enemy]]...), the delaying Trooper can declare their ARO.
* If the Trooper in Impersonation State does not reveal themselves, the delaying Trooper loses their right to declare an ARO.
* Impersonation has two levels, each with its own specific features:

==Impersonation-1==
{{image | name=n5/impersonation-state-1.jpg | style= 128inline }}
* In Impersonation-1 State, the player does not place the Model on the table but instead places an Impersonation-1 Marker (IMP-1).
* To reveal an Impersonation-1 Marker, a [[Discover]] Roll must be passed, applying a '''-3 MOD'''.
* If the Discover Roll is successful, the Trooper enters Impersonation-2 State. Replace the Impersonation-1 Marker with an Impersonation-2 Marker (IMP-2).

==Impersonation-2==
{{image | name=n5/impersonation-state-2.jpg | style= 128inline }}
* In the Impersonation-2 State, the player does not place the Model on the table but instead places an Impersonation-2 Marker (IMP-2).
* To reveal an Impersonation-2 Marker, a [[Discover]] Roll must be passed.
* If the Discover Roll is successful, the Impersonation-2 Marker is replaced with the corresponding Model, facing in any direction its player chooses.


{{cancellation}}
The Impersonation State is canceled, and the Impersonation Marker is replaced with the corresponding Model whenever:
* The Impersonation Marker declares an [[Attack]] or any Skill that requires a Roll.
* The Impersonation Marker declares a [[Long Skill]] of any kind, other than [[Cautious Movement]].
* The Impersonation Marker enters [[Silhouette contact]] with an enemy Model.
* The Impersonation-2 Marker (IMP-2) is [[Discover]]ed.
* The Trooper is or becomes [[Impetuous]] (due to having the [[Frenzy]] Special Skill or any other effect) or enters [[Retreat State | Retreat! State]].
* When Impersonation State is canceled, its player must replace the Marker with the corresponding Model, facing in any direction the player chooses.
* When replacing the Marker with the Model, the player must provide their adversary with the Trooper's complete [[Open Information]].

{{see-also}}
'''[[Impersonation]]'''
* Allows the user to deploy in the [[Impersonation State | Impersonation-1 (IMP-1) State]].
* '''Restriction''': Troopers whose Unit Profile indicates that they have Impersonation (IMP-2) may only deploy and activate the [[Impersonation State | Impersonation-2 (IMP-2) State]].


'''[[Cybermask]]'''
* The user enters the [[Impersonation State | Impersonation-2 state]], which does not require a Roll, replacing the user's model with an Impersonation-2 Marker (IMP-2).

== Important Notes & Reminders ==

{{important}}
[[Enemy | Enemies]] perceive an impersonator in the Impersonation-1 or Impersonation-2 State (IMP-1 or IMP-2 Marker) as an ally.
{{important-end}}


{{important}}
The [[Discover]] Skill cannot be declared twice against the same Marker in an Order. You may, however, attempt to Discover two different Markers in the same Order.
{{important-end}}


{{important}}
Cancellation of Impersonation State is applied to the entirety of the declared [[Order Expenditure Sequence | Order]], even if the Skill revealing the Impersonating Trooper is performed at the end of the Order.
{{important-end}}


{{remember}}
ARO against a Marker:
* The only [[ARO]]s that can be declared against an Impersonation Marker (IMP-1, IMP-2) are [[Discover]], [[Dodge]], [[Look Out]]! or [[Reset]].
* Against a Marker, the enemy can delay declaring their ARO until it declares the second Short Skill of its Order.
* In this case, they may declare an ARO only if the Impersonation Marker reveals themselves with the second Short Skill of their Order. If the second Short Skill of the Order does not reveal the Marker, the Trooper loses their right to declare an ARO.
{{remember-end}}


{{remember}}
Impersonation Markers are considered [[Allied]] Troopers, so [[Attack]]s cannot be declared against them. Any shot with a [[Template Weapon]] that affects an Impersonation Marker is canceled, even if another [[Enemy]] Trooper was designated as the Main Target

The only exception is declaring [[Discover]] + [[BS Attack]] against a Marker (IMP-2) and passing a [[Discover]] Roll if the Marker does not reveal itself with an [[ARO]].
{{remember-end}}


{{see-also}}
'''[[Biometric Visor]]'''
* The user ignores the [[WIP]]-3 MOD imposed by the [[Impersonation State|Impersonation-1 State]].
* If the user passes a [[Discover]] Roll against a Trooper in Impersonation-1 State, that Trooper's Impersonation State is canceled and their IMP-1 Marker is replaced with the corresponding Model.
* Users of a Biometric Visor ignore [[Surprise Attack]] MODs from attackers benefitting from [[Impersonation State | Impersonation]] or [[Holoecho State]]s, if they have [[LoF]] to the attacker. In addition, they also ignore Surprise Attack MODs from [[CC Attack]]s from those attackers even if they don't have LoF to the attacker.

== Examples ==

{{greybox-start | Impersonation Example: Regaining Impersonation vs Hidden Deployment }}
In her [[Active Turn]], a player wants one of her Models with the [[Impersonation]] Special Skill to return to the Impersonation-1 Marker State. She confirms that there aren’t any enemy Models or Markers with [[LoF]] to her Trooper, and spends one [[Trooper Activation | Order]] to disguise him under an Impersonation-1 Marker. Her opponent knows he has a Trooper in [[Hidden Deployment State | Hidden Deployment]] who would have LoF to the Active Trooper. However, as the Hidden Deployment Trooper is not on the table as a Model or Marker, he cannot disrupt the Active Trooper’s declaration of regaining the Impersonation-1 Marker State. Once the [[Long Skill]] has been declared, the Hidden Deployment Trooper nevertheless has the chance to reveal himself and declare an [[ARO]], disrupting the execution of the Order—it cannot be carried out if it fails to comply with its Requirements—and making the Active Trooper lose his Order as it becomes illegal.

In addition, if the Trooper in Hidden Deployment were to declare an [[Attack]] as his ARO, he would make a [[Normal]] Roll.
{{greybox-end}}


{{greybox-start | Impersonation Example 2 }}
{{image | name=n5/eng-impersonation-state-examples-1.jpg | style=fullborder }}

During her [[Active Turn]], a Speculo Killer in Impersonation-1 (IMP-1) State declares the first Short Skill of her Order: [[Move]].
Now, the three Enemy Troopers with [[LoF]] to the Speculo Killer may declare their [[ARO]]s.

Troopers 2 and 3 declare [[Discover]], while Trooper 1 delays their ARO.

With the second half of the Order, the Speculo Killer declares Move again, placing herself in an advantageous position for her next Order.

As the Speculo Killer declared Move + Move, Trooper 1 has lost the right to ARO, since the Impersonated Trooper has not been revealed. Troopers 2 and 3 make their respective Discover Rolls and are both successful.

Despite both Troopers getting successes, the Active Player only replaces the IMP-1 Marker with an IMP-2 Marker and the Trooper stays in Marker form.
