In Infinity, every Weapon has its own game profile and some of them even have special usage rules. This chapter describes how to read such a profile and details each Weapon individually. The CC Weapon will be used as an example to explain how to read a Melee Weapon profile.

'''[[Range]]''' indicates the Weapon's reach in inches. Melee Weapons usually lack a Range.

'''[[Possibility of Survival (PS)]]''' indicates the destructive capability of the Weapon. The lower the PS value, the more powerful the Weapon.

'''[[Burst]] (B)''' is the number of dice the Active Player must roll when declaring a [[CC Attack]]. '''Remember that in the Reactive Turn the value of B is generally 1''', unless modified by a rule or Skill.

The '''[[Ammunition]]''' column indicates what Type of Ammunition the Weapon uses. If two Types of Ammunition are shown linked by a "+" it means both Types are combined.

The '''[[Saving Roll]] Attribute''' column indicates which [[Attribute]] or Attributes ([[ARM]], [[BTS]], [[PH]], ARM+BTS, etc.) any Saving Rolls are made against to avoid the hit's damage or Effects. As with Ammunition, saving against different Attributes or their combination may be necessary (see [[Saving Roll]]s (SR)). The Attribute can also be shown with MODs, usually negative (-3, -6), or it can directly show the value for that Attribute (ARM=0).

The '''Number of [[Saving Roll]]s''' (SR: No.) column indicates the number of Saving Rolls that need to be made for every hit received.

'''Traits''' are special features some Weapons and Equipment pieces possess. They are all explained in the [[Labels]] and [[Traits]] Section. An asterisk (*) in this section indicates that the Weapon or piece of Equipment has extra rules in the corresponding section of the rulebook.

{{n5_weaponrow|Monofilament CC Weapon| | | | | | | |8|1|N|ARM&#61;0|1|[[CC]], [[State Trait | State:]] [[Dead]]}}
|}

In the case of the Monofilament CC Weapon, its [[Saving Roll]] Attribute indicates that the target will have their [[ARM]] value reduced to 0 for their [[Saving Roll]] and its [[Traits]] indicate that, should they receive any [[Wounds]], they will enter [[Dead State]] directly.
