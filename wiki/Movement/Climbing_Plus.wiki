Troopers with Climbing Plus are particularly gifted in or equipped for climbing and vertical relocation.

{{css_skillbox |black| CLIMBING PLUS | AUTOMATIC SKILL }}
{{skill-label | Movement, Optional. }}
{{requirements}}
* At the end of the movement, Troopers must be able to place themselves on a surface that is equal or larger than their base.
{{effects}}
* With this Special Skill, the [[Climb]] Long Skill is turned into a Basic Short Skill, if declared as the first Basic Short Skill of the Order.
* Climbing Plus also allows the user to move on vertical surfaces as if performing normal Movement on a horizontal surface when declaring [[Move]] or [[Dodge]], or during movement due to a failed [[Guts Roll]]. The [[General Movement Rules]] and [[Moving and Measuring]] chapter must be applied. 
* The Climbing Plus Special Skill allows its user to perform other Basic Short Skills or Short Skills (e.g. Move + [[BS Attack]]) while moving on a vertical surface, or if hanging from a height (see [[Trooper Activation]]).
* '''Restriction''': The Trooper can only declare Climb as a Basic Short Skill '''once per Order'''. If the Trooper then declares Move as their second Basic Short Skill, this uses the second value of their [[MOV]] Attribute.
* '''Restriction''': As with the Climb Skill, Troopers using Climbing Plus do not benefit from [[Partial Cover]] MODs while they are on a vertical surface.
* For visualization purposes, Troopers using this Skill move with at least half of their base's underside in contact with the vertical surface, as indicated in the Requirements of the Move and Climb Skills.
* During the Reactive Turn, Climbing Plus allows its owner to react in [[ARO]], if applicable, while being on a vertical surface.
* If the Trooper is or becomes [[Impetuous]] (due to having the [[Frenzy]] Skill or due to any other rule), they will be able to use Climbing Plus in the [[Impetuous Phase]].

{{Important-start}}
Troopers cannot be deployed on vertical surfaces during the [[Deployment Phase]] or during the game.
{{important-end}}


{{Remember-start}}
* When declaring the use of Climbing Plus, the complete and exact trajectory that Trooper will perform must be specified so the rival player may declare all their AROs.
* Troopers have a 360Â° [[LoF]] during their entire trajectory.

==Examples==
{{greybox-start | Example of Climbing Plus}}
{{image | name=n5/eng-climbing-plus-1.jpg | style=fullborder }}

Spending an Order, the Trooper declares [[Move]] as the first Skill of their Order. Thanks to their Climbing Plus Special Skill, as the Trooper moves their first two inches and reaches the obstacle, they may continue their movement on the vertical surface, as if it was a horizontal surface.

Likewise, with the second Skill of their Order, they can choose to keep moving, or can declare any other Short Skill or Basic Short Skill such as [[BS Attack]], [[Discover]], etc.

Since there are no enemies in sight, the Trooper keeps moving.

With a second Order, they declare Move + Move, so they climb down the obstacle and advance until they have used all their movement.
