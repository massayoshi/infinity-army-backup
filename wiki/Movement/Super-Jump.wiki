Troopers with Super-Jump have the ability to perform super-human jumping feats thanks to special gear, augmentations, or evolutionary advantages.

{{skill-label | Movement, Optional. }}
{{effects}}
* With this Special Skill, the [[Jump]] [[Long Skill]] is turned into a [[Basic Short Skill]], '''if declared as the first Basic Short Skill of the Order'''.
* The Super-Jump Special Skill allows its user to perform other Basic Short Skills or Short Skills while performing a Jump (for example: Jump + [[BS Attack]]) (see [[Trooper Activation]]).
* '''Restriction:''' The Trooper can only declare Jump as a Basic Short Skill '''once per Order'''. If the Trooper then declares [[Move]] as their second Basic Short Skill, this uses the second value of their [[MOV]] Attribute. 
* If the user declares Jump as a Long Skill, they can Jump up to their first MOV value plus 4 inches, instead of the usual 2 inches of the Jump Skill.
* '''Restriction:''' When they declare Jump, Troopers with Super-Jump cannot benefit from [[Partial Cover]] MODs anywhere along their trajectory.
* If the Trooper is or becomes [[Impetuous]] (due to having the [[Frenzy]] Characteristic or any other effect), they can use Super-Jump in the [[Impetuous Phase]].
* Some Troopers have the Super-Jump Skill listed in their [[Unit Profile]] with a distance shown in round brackets. When Jumping, the Trooper can add this distance to their Jump, instead of the usual 2 inches of the Jump Skill.

=== Super-Jump (Jet Propulsion) ===
* '''Super-Jump (Jet Propulsion)''': Troopers with this Skill listed in their Unit Profile have full control of the trajectory of their Jumps. The Trooper can freely change direction and heading in mid-air as many times as they wish while jumping (see examples).

{{remember-start}}
When declaring the use of Super-Jump, the complete and exact trajectory that a Trooper will perform must be specified so the rival player may declare all their [[ARO]]s.

During their entire trajectory, Troopers have a 360Â° [[LoF]].

When [[Jump]] is declared, the [[Prone State]] is automatically cancelled.

== Examples ==

{{greybox-start | Super-Jump Example}}
{{image | name=n5/dual-super-jump-example-1.jpg | style=fullborder }}

During their Active Turn, a Trooper with Super-Jump needs to get past an obstacle. As the obstacle is higher than their [[Silhouette Template]], the Trooper must declare [[Jump]] in order to pass over it. Thanks to their Special Skill, the Trooper may declare another Short Skill, such as [[BS Attack]] during the Jump.

{{greybox-start | Super-Jump and Multiple Troopers Example}}
In the Active Turn, several Troopers have been activated with the same Order ([[Fireteams in the Active Turn | Fireteams]], [[Peripheral]]s, [[Coordinated Orders]]) and need to clear an obstacle. They declare [[Jump]] as the first Skill of the Order. Any of the Troopers who have the Super-Jump Special Skill can declare Jump as a [[Basic Short Skill]], while the other Troopers each have a choice of declaring Jump as a [[Long Skill]], or declaring an [[Idle]].

For the second Skill of the Order, any of the Troopers who declared an Idle, or Jump as a Basic Short Skill, can declare a second Basic Short Skill or Short Skill as normal. While the Troopers who declared Jump as a Long Skill have already declared their entire Order and cannot declare a second Skill.

{{greybox-start | Super-Jump (Jet Propulsion)}}
{{image | name=n5/dual-super-jump-example-2.jpg | style=fullborder }}

In his Active Turn, a Trooper with Super-Jump wants to Attack an enemy Trooper, but without leaving themselves exposed in the next Order. In addition, an obstacle is blocking his [[LoF]]. So, he decides to use his Super-Jump (Jet Propulsion) Special Skill to perform a diagonal Jump, tracing a path that clears the obstacle blocking his LoF allowing him to shoot at the enemy Trooper, and then chooses to return back to the starting position of his Jump.

As shown in the picture, a Trooper with Super-Jump (Jet Propulsion) can freely change their trajectory through the air until they reach the designated landing spot.
